I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WEST BOW BALL.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last of the West Bow balls
before Lady Charlotte ran away with her dancing-master was on a
dirty evening in November.&nbsp; Edinburgh was all day wrapped in
haar, and now came rain that made the gutters run like mountain
burns and overflow into the closes, to fall in shallow cataracts
to the plain below.&nbsp; There was a lively trade in the
taverns.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord! there&rsquo;s a sneezer for
ye!&rdquo; said the customers ordering in their ale, not really
minding the weather much, for it was usual and gave a good excuse
for more assiduous scourging of the nine-gallon tree; <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>but their
wives, spanging awkwardly on pattens through the mud on their way
to the fishwife at the Luckenbooths for the supper haddocks, had
such a breeze in their petticoats and plaids they were in a
terror that they should be blown away upon the blasts that came
up the gulleys between the towering &ldquo;lands,&rdquo; and
daring slates and chimney-pots, and the hazards of emptied
vessels from the flats above, kept close to the wall as luggers
scrape the shore of Fife when the gale&rsquo;s
nor&rsquo;-west.</p>
<p>Lady Charlotte was director of the dance&mdash;a creature most
majestic, who ballooned about the room as if not her feet but her
big hooped petticoat conveyed her, the only woman without a mask;
that in her office would be useless.&nbsp; All the other women
kept theirs on, with silken cords bit between the teeth (except
when a favourite partner caused a titter).&nbsp; Below the
velvet, when it tilted up, they showed the cheeks of youth and
beauty, sometimes a little high in the <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>bone for classic taste, and a patch on
the chin just at the point where to a resolute lad it looked like
a defiance.&nbsp; The flute, the hautbois, and the &rsquo;cello
gave body to the melody of the harpsichord, somewhat flat the
whole of them, for the place was sweltering, and the stuccoed
ceiling sweated, and the walls.</p>
<p>A gentleman, conspicuous from the fact that he wore no wig,
stood in the dusk at the foot of the room, away from the
guttering candelabra, and put up his hand to hide a yawn.&nbsp;
The minuet was beyond him, and seemed to him who came from the
wilds, where the languid had no place in merriment, a somewhat
insipid affair.&nbsp; In the card-room, where old dowagers played
cards till their girls should be ready to go home, and the young
ones sat with their chosen gallants, sipping tea in the latest
manner, he had ventured a harmless remark to a lady neither too
young nor too lovely to resent a politeness at a masque assembly,
and she <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>had
fled to her friends as if he were an ogre.</p>
<p>He was neither surprised nor vexed; he was accustomed to have
the fair avoid him, though scarcely with such obvious
fastidiousness as to-night.&nbsp; It was one of the things to be
expected by a man with a crooked nose and the plainness of his
other features in conformity with that one, even if he had not
happened to be there incognito.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the devil!&rdquo; said he to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
cannot expect them to be civil to any casual Jo at a
two-and-sixpenny ball.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he yawned again,
impatient for the coming away of his cousin, whose gallantries to
a lady at the other end of the room seemed unending.&nbsp; From
that cousin he neither expected the ordinary courtesies of life
nor desired them.&nbsp; They were usually as cool to each other
as if they had sprung from different clans, and it was only the
accident of a law plea affecting the family in its various
branches that brought them privately <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>to the capital and to the same
lodgings from widely different parts of their native shire, and
from widely different ways of life.</p>
<p>Whatever the cousin had to say to madam, she was pretty merry
on the head of it, and seemed entranced with her gallant.&nbsp;
He was such a coxcomb surely as never before came off the
heather, with his Genoa velvet coat, his sky-blue breeches, and a
waistcoat of the tartan of his clan, a thin, delicate, lady-like
sword at his haunch that better knew the swing of the
claymore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rogue, Jock! and a tongue to wile the bird off the
tree,&rdquo; thought the man with the crooked nose, in no envy at
all, but just in a distaste at nature&rsquo;s perversity; and he
saw that his cousin and the lady looked at him as if he were the
object of their conversation.</p>
<p>To his astonishment, the lady, at the forming of the next
quadrille, was brought to him by Lady Charlotte.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
see, if the mountain &rsquo;ll not come to Mahomet, <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Mahomet maun
just come to the mountain,&rdquo; said the directress
airily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a leddy I&rsquo;m determined
shall not miss her quadrille, and you are very lucky,
Mr&mdash;Mr&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdonald,&rdquo; said he, with a bow and a glance of
shrewdness at the young lady, who had plainly made the
arrangements herself for the introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Macdonald&mdash;just so! a rale decent clan,&rdquo;
said Lady Charlotte, who prided herself upon the quality of her
Scots.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mind you had the tickets from Lord Duthie;
you&rsquo;re lucky to have the chance of the bonniest partner in
the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it,&rdquo; said he, with
another glance at a very soothfast mask that came down on as
sweet a pair of lips as ever man took craving for.</p>
<p>At a quadrille he was not amiss if one could get over the
crook in his nose and the rugged plainness of his countenance
generally.&nbsp; When he was done and brought the lady to a seat,
she was good enough to say <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>he danced divinely.&nbsp; She had
herself the carriage of a swan, her voice was of a ravishing and
caressing quality, with none of the harsh, high-pitched,
East-country accent that would have grated on Macdonald&rsquo;s
ears, and yet there was a something shallow in her phrase and
sentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good to say so, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I
rarely dance, and I have seldom danced less at an assembly than I
have done to-night,&rdquo; said he, taking the compliment at its
real value, for his dancing was a point on which he had no
illusions.</p>
<p>The lady toyed with her fan; her eyes, mischievous and
profound as wells and of the hue of plums, sparkled through the
holes in her mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh la! and you divine at it, I declare!&nbsp; Our
Edinburgh belles, then, do not tempt you, Mr Macdonald?&nbsp; But
I daresay you will think them quite good enough for our Edinburgh
beaux; now, did you ever in your life see such gawks?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Macdonald rubbed his chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the
contrary,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was just thinking them
uncommon spruce and handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very tolerant; have you any other virtues to be
aired?&rdquo; said the lady with a smile that puzzled him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still another dance, I see; her ladyship is
fairly in the key to-night; you&rsquo;ll have time to tell me all
of them seriatim, missing out the lesser ones <i>brevitatis
causa</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;her father&rsquo;s
in the law,&rdquo; and wondered who she was.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could
tell you all of them in the time it would take to dance a step of
the Highland Fling,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, there&rsquo;s modesty!&nbsp; Item, Mr
Macdonald?&rdquo; and she sat back in her chair, her hoops bulged
out in front of her like the bastion of a fort.</p>
<p>He counted them on his fingers humorously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Item,
the tolerance you have given me credit for, though you have no
example of it as yet, madam; item, an honest liking <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>for my
fellows, even the scamps of them; item, a habit of aye paying my
way; item&mdash;&rdquo; his forefinger hovered dubiously over the
other hand, but never lighted on another virtue.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
declare to you I have got to the end of my list and the man has
not yet finished the tuning of his fiddle,&rdquo; he said,
laughing in a way so pleasant it almost made amends for his
unhappy nose.</p>
<p>He had taken a seat beside her, she tapped him with her fan
upon the knees with an air of the superior that struck him as a
little droll, and, looking straight in his face, said in an
affected Scots, as if to take the sting from the words:
&ldquo;A&rsquo; very fine, Maister Macdonald, a&rsquo; very
fine!&nbsp; What have ye given me here but twa-three virtues that
come&mdash;except maybe the last&mdash;so easy to maist folk
they&rsquo;re nae mair to your credit than that you should sup
kail wi&rsquo; a spoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor show, I confess it, ma&rsquo;am; if you want a
list of more brilliant virtues, <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>you should try my worthy cousin, your
last partner,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you tell me that&mdash;Barrisdale?&rdquo; said the
lady, burring her &ldquo;r&rsquo;s&rdquo; with a gusto to make
him certain she had no dubiety regarding his identity.</p>
<p>He could not hide a little start of surprise, for he thought
the secret of his cousin and himself being in Edinburgh was known
to but two men there, Lord Duthie and Mackee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the daughter of Lord Duthie,&rdquo; said
he, remembering her law Latinity.</p>
<p>She was confused at so shrewd a guess, but admitted he was
right.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has long been my wish,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;to have a crack with a Highland rob&mdash;, with a
Highland person of your experience; and I must confess I asked
Lady Charlotte for the introduction, though you may not think it
modest.&nbsp; Let me tell you that I&rsquo;m disappointed; it ill
becomes a gentleman of Barrisdale&rsquo;s reputation to be
claiming such <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>paltry common virtues as those you have named to charm
the ear of an unknown lady in a mask.&nbsp; They credit ye with
Latin and French, and say ye cut a dash whiles in London&mdash;oh
la! a wonnerfu&rsquo; man entirely!&mdash;but upon my word, I
never thought to get a catechist in my Hielan cateran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a comedy,&rdquo; thought he, looking
across the room to his cousin.&nbsp; &ldquo;How in the world did
you discover me?&rdquo; he asked her; &ldquo;did my
cousin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and he told me not to
mention it; but you see, I take the privilege of my
sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot but be flattered at your interest,
ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m sure, and I hope you will not let the
thing go further so long as I&rsquo;m in Edinburgh.&nbsp; Now
that I&rsquo;m discovered, I&rsquo;m wae to be back to my ruffian
gang,&rdquo; said he, with a quizzing air.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must
have a most tremendous reputation, and I would not wonder if you
could go over all my history.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;I daresay I know the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&nbsp; Faith! it&rsquo;s more than I do myself;
might I ask you to be jogging my memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I come to think of it,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the
very virtues that you claim are what in the rough bounds of the
Hielans may well manifest themselves in fashions that hereabouts
in lalland towns we clap men into jyle for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I should not wonder, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s counted a crime in one parish, even in
the Hielans, is often looked on as a Christian act in others not
a glen removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk of tolerance, Barrisdale; was it that made you
hide in Ben Alder for a twelvemonth the man that shot
Breadalbane&rsquo;s factor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a very old man, the factor, Miss Duthie,&rdquo;
said he glibly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would have died in another
winter, anyway, by all appearances, and not half so handsomely <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>as with a
bullet.&nbsp; And the poor fellow who shot him&mdash;you would
not have us send a man with a wife and ten of a family to the
gallows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; cried the lady, affecting to be out of
patience.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a rebel too, my father tells me,
and all for having back those Papist Stuarts and putting the dear
King away out of the country.&nbsp; Is that a sample of your love
for your fellowmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Logic,&rdquo; thought Macdonald, &ldquo;is not a branch
that&rsquo;s taught with the virginals and tambouring in
lawyers&rsquo; families.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;could you blame me?&nbsp; I
have been in France a while myself, and I ken the kind of drink
they have to drink there; I would not poison dogs with it.&nbsp;
I would have Jamie back for no other reason than to save what
relics of his stomach may be to the fore.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that
but love for my fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it that made you fight with the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>London
gentleman and send him&mdash;poor soul&mdash;to his Maker at five
o&rsquo;clock on a cold winter morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small world.&nbsp; Who would have thought
the gossip of that trivial affair would have travelled to an
Edinburgh assembly?&nbsp; Sure you would not have had me put off
the occasion till the summer weather; we were both warm enough at
the time, I assure you, or that black folly they call a duel had
never been engaged in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the name of&mdash;of&mdash;I hate to mention
it,&rdquo; said the lady, now grown eager and biting her under
lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, out with it! out with it!&nbsp; Crown Counsel
should never be blate, ma&rsquo;am; on my word, the talent for
cross-examination would seem to run in the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackmail and&mdash;&rdquo; said she in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One at a time!&rdquo; said Macdonald.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the prose way of putting it; up north we put
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>it
differently.&nbsp; You call it robbery; we call it rent.&nbsp;
Some charge the rent by the pennyland or the acre; we charge it
by the sound night&rsquo;s sleep, and the man who rents immunity
from his cattle from Barrisdale gets as good value for his money
as the man who rents some acres of dirt from Appin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madam worked her fan industriously&mdash;now she was on his
heels, and could not spare so plain a mercenary.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
steal cattle,&rdquo; was her next charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steal! ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Barrisdale, with a
frown.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not the bonniest word; up north we call
it <i>togail</i>&mdash;lifting.&nbsp; It is an odd world,
mistress, and every man of us has to do some sort of lifting for
a living&mdash;if not in the glen, then in the market-place,
where the act is covered in a fine confusion.&nbsp; If we lift a
<i>creach</i> now and then in Barrisdale there are other clans
that lift from us, and at the season&rsquo;s end no one is much
the worse, and there has been much frolic and
diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;On the same reasoning, then, you would justify
the attempt at abducting Glen Nant&rsquo;s rich daughter?&rdquo;
said the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to have seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the lady, and could not for her
life have kept from smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the sight of her
spoiled what small romantics I had about the Hielan
cateran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure there are none to the fore yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a morsel!&rdquo; said the lady, looking point-blank
at his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mo thruagh</i>!&rdquo; said Macdonald tragically;
&ldquo;then are we indeed forsaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made a shabby flight, by all accounts, from the
lady&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said he, for the first time disconcerted;
indeed, it was a story no way creditable to Clan Macdonald.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll better let
that flea stick to the wall,&rdquo; and looked across the room to
where his cousin sat glowering in a manifest anxiety.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Oh, Barrisdale, Barrisdale, can ye no&rsquo; be a
good man?&rdquo; said Miss Duthie, in a petty lady-like concern,
and unable to keep her eyes from that unlucky nose.</p>
<p>He put up his hand and covered it.&nbsp; She flushed to the
neck that he should so easily have divined her, and he
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use trying, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me be as good as gold and I would never get
credit for it from your sex, that must always fancy that a
handsome face never goes but with a handsome heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose with an air of vexation to leave him, very red below
her mask; the last dance was on the point of ending, the dowagers
were coming in with their Paisley plaids on their
shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would never hurt any person&rsquo;s
feelings by allusion to his personal appearance,&rdquo; she said,
as she was turning away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;you are most considerate.&rdquo;</p>

20</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FIRE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Macdonald</span> and his cousin Jock
walked to their lodging in Halkerston&rsquo;s Wynd without a
lanthorn.&nbsp; The watch cried, &ldquo;Twal o&rsquo;clock, twal
o&rsquo;clock, and a perishin&rsquo; cauld nicht&rdquo;; they
could hear the splash of his shoes in the puddles of the lane
although they could not see him.&nbsp; The town now rose above
the haar that brooded in the swampy hollow underneath the
citadel; the rain was gone, the stars were clear, the wind moaned
in the lanes and whistled on the steep.&nbsp; It was like as they
were in some wizard fortress cut from rock, walking in mirk
ravines, the enormous houses dizzy overhanging them, the <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>closes
running to the plains on either hand in sombre gashes.&nbsp;
Before them went sedans and swinging lanterns and flambeaux that
left in their wake an odour of tow and rosin not in its way
unpleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yon was a dubious prank upon the lady,&rdquo; said
Macdonald, and his cousin laughed uproariously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Donald,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could
not for the life of me resist it.&nbsp; I declare it was better
than a play; I have paid good money for worse at a
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still and on a roguish thing,&rdquo; said
Macdonald, hastening his step.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were aye the
rogue, Jaunty Jock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were aye the dullard, Dismal Dan,&rdquo;
retorted the other in no bad humour at the accusation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To be dull is, maybe, worse.&nbsp; You had the
opportunity&mdash;I risked that&mdash;to betray me if you
liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew very well I would not do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought not, and if you did not <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>take the
chance to clear yourself when you got it, there&rsquo;s no one
but yourself to blame.&nbsp; Here was madam&mdash;quite
romantical about the Highlands, as I found at our first country
dance, and languishing to see this Barrisdale that she has heard
from some one&mdash;(who the devil knows? that beats
me)&mdash;was to be at Lady Charlotte&rsquo;s ball.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say he&rsquo;s my own cousin,&rsquo;
says I&mdash;&lsquo;a Hielan cousin, it does not count when
rogues are in the family.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You must point him
out to me,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; I gave her three guesses to
pick out the likeliest in the room, and she took you at the first
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most discerning young person!&rdquo; said
Macdonald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knew your history like a sennachie, lad, and rogue
as she made you, I believe she would have forgiven you all but
for that nose of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, damn my nose!&rdquo; cried Macdonald.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so very different from the common type of
noses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;Just that! just that! not very different, but
still a little skew.&nbsp; Lord! man, you cannot expect to have
all the graces as well as all the virtues.&nbsp; Madam picked you
out at all events, and I was not in the key to contradict
her.&nbsp; She paid you (or was it me?) the compliment of saying
you were not at all like her idea of a man with the repute of
Barrisdale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely!&nbsp; Indeed, I could guess she was more
put out at that than at finding herself speaking to a scamp who
laughed at his own misdeeds.&nbsp; You made a false move; Jock,
had you admitted you were the man, she would not have been
greatly mortified.&nbsp; In any case, she thought to improve the
occasion with advice.&nbsp; She told me to be good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barrisdale could hardly speak for laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
kept up the play at any rate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for when I
saw her to her chair, &lsquo;Yon&rsquo;s an awful man, your
cousin,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; What do you think of
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;Something of a simpleton, something of a
sentimentalist, and a very bonny face forbye to judge by her
chin&mdash;that was all of it I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She kept too tight a mask for even me to see her
face.&nbsp; Man, ye&rsquo;ve missed her chief charm&mdash;she has
twa thousand a year of her own.&nbsp; I had it from herself, so
you see I&rsquo;m pretty far ben.&nbsp; With half a chance I
could make a runaway match of it; I&rsquo;m sure I took her
fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts! Jock.&nbsp; I thought you had enough of runaway
matches; take care she has not got a brother,&rdquo; said
Macdonald.</p>
<p>Jaunty Jock scowled in the dark, but made no answer.</p>
<p>Their lodging was in a land deep down in the Wynd.&nbsp; Flat
on flat it rose for fourteen stories, poverty in its dunnies (as
they called its cellars), poverty in its attics, and between the
two extremes the wonderfullest variety of households bien or
wealthy&mdash;the homes of writers, clerks, ministers, <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>shopkeepers,
tradesmen, gentlemen reduced, a countess, and a judge&mdash;for
there, though the Macdonalds did not know, dwelt Lord Duthie with
his daughter.&nbsp; In daytime the traffic of the steep scale
stair went like the road to a fair, at night the passages were
black and still as vaults.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine place the town, no
doubt,&rdquo; said Jaunty Jock, &ldquo;but, lord, give me the
hills for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slept in different rooms.&nbsp; The morning was still
young when one of them was wakened by the most appalling uproar
on the stair.&nbsp; He rose and saw his window glowing; he looked
from it, and over on the gables of the farther land he saw the
dance of light from a fire.&nbsp; He wakened Jaunty Jock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the tenement&rsquo;s in
blazes.&rdquo;&nbsp; They dressed in a hurry, and found that
every one in the house but themselves had fled already.&nbsp; The
door stood open; on the landing crushed the tenants from the
flats above, men and women in a state of horror, fighting like
brutes for their <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>safety.&nbsp; The staircase rang with cries&mdash;the
sobbing of women, the whimper of bairns, and at the foot a
doorway jammed.&nbsp; Frantic to find themselves caught like
rats, and the sound of the crackling fire behind them, the
trapped ones elbowed and tore for escape, and only the narrowness
of the passage kept the weaker ones from being trampled
underfoot.&nbsp; All this Macdonald could define only by the
evidence of his ears, for the stair was wholly in pitch
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God! we&rsquo;ll burn alive!&rdquo; said Jaunty
Jock, every shred of his manhood gone, and trembling like a
leaf.&nbsp; Their door was in a lobby recessed from the
landing&mdash;an eddy wherein some folk almost naked drifted
weeping to find themselves helpless of getting farther.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the fire?&rdquo; asked Macdonald from one of
them, and had to shake him before he got an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two landings farther up,&rdquo; said the fellow,
&ldquo;in Lord Duthie&rsquo;s flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;Lord Duthie&rsquo;s flat!&rdquo; cried Macdonald;
&ldquo;and is he safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s never hame yet; at least, I never heard him
skliffin&rsquo; on the stair, but his dochter cam&rsquo; back
hersel&rsquo; frae the assembly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she safe?&rdquo; asked Macdonald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo; kens that?&rdquo; replied the man, and threw
himself into the stair, the more able now to fight because of his
rest in the eddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks gey bad for your runaway match, Jock,&rdquo;
said Macdonald.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a parcel of the most
arrant cowards.&nbsp; My God, what a thin skin of custom lies
between the burgess and the brute beast.&nbsp; That poor
lass!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s for you and me, Jock, to go up and see
that she&rsquo;s in no greater danger than the rest of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke to deaf ears, for Jock was already fighting for his
place among the crowd.&nbsp; His cousin did the same, but with
another purpose: his object was to scale the stair.&nbsp; He
pushed against the pressure of the panic, mountains were on his
shoulders, <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>and his ribs were squeezed into his body as if with
falling rocks.&nbsp; His clothes were torn from his back, he lost
his shoes, and a frantic woman struck him on the face with the
heavy key of her door that with a housewife&rsquo;s carefulness
she treasured even when the door it was meant for was burned, and
the blood streamed into his eyes.</p>
<p>He was still in the dark of the stair; the fire at least was
not close enough to stop his mounting, so up he felt his way in a
hurry till he reached Lord Duthie&rsquo;s flat.&nbsp; A lobby
that led to the left from the landing roared with flame that
scorched him; a lobby on the right was still untouched.&nbsp; He
hammered at the only shut door but got no answer, plied the risp
as well with the same result, then threw it in with a drive of
the shoulders.&nbsp; He gave a cry in the entrance and, getting
no response, started to go through the rooms.&nbsp; At the third
the lady sat up in her bed and cried at the intruder.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;The land&rsquo;s on fire, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said he quietly in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; she cried in horror.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, what
shall I do?&nbsp; Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barrisdale,&rdquo; said he, remembering his role and
determined to make this his last appearance in it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have plenty of time to dress, and I&rsquo;ll wait for
you on the landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out with a sudden project in his mind, ran down the
stair with its litter of rags and footwear and found it almost
vacant, the obstruction at the bottom being cleared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take your time, my friends,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s not the slightest danger; the fire will not
get this length for half an hour yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His cousin came back from the crush.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
sure&rsquo;s death, I&rsquo;m glad to see you and sorry I never
bided,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never came on her; I knew
very well she must have got out at the outset.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Barrisdale.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
it happens, she&rsquo;s yonder yet, and I had the honour to wake
her; I fancy she&rsquo;s taking her hair from the curl-papers at
this moment.&nbsp; You never had a better chance of getting
credit for a fine action very cheaply.&nbsp; It was in the dark I
wakened her; I told her I was Barrisdale and would return when
she was dressed.&nbsp; You may go back to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said the cousin;
&ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the object?&rdquo; he added
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that I&rsquo;m tired of being Barrisdale to suit
you.&nbsp; If you like to be Barrisdale and carry your own
reputation, you&rsquo;ll have the name of saving her
life&mdash;one thing at least to your credit that&rsquo;ll maybe
make her forget the rest.&nbsp; With a creature so romantical, I
would not wonder if it came to the runaway match after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; said Jaunty Jock, and
ran up the stair.&nbsp; He came down with <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the lady on
his arm, and took her to a neighbour&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you confess to your identity?&rdquo; asked his
cousin when they met again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; he answered gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely she did not boggle at the Barrisdale; I was
certain it would make little odds to a lady of her
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she was willing enough, but it&rsquo;s not a
match,&rdquo; said Jaunty Jock.&nbsp; &ldquo;After this,
I&rsquo;ll always see the mask off first; she had a worse nose
than yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>YOUNG
PENNYMORE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the half-dozen men of Mid-Argyll
condemned on one account or another for their part in the
Rebellion, the last, and the least deserving of so scurvy a fate,
was young John Clerk of Pennymore.&nbsp; He had been out in the
affair more for the fun of the thing than from any high passion
of politics; he would have fought as readily for the Duke as for
the Young Pretender if the Duke had appealed to him first; he was
a likeable lad to all who knew him, and the apple of his
mother&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>The hanging of young John Clerk seemed at the time all the
more harsh a measure since he was not charged directly with
rebellion, but with being actor or art and <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>part in the
death of the Captain of Clonary, who was shot on his way from
Culloden by a gang of lurking Jacobites of whom the lad was one,
and maybe innocent.&nbsp; The murderers scattered to the mist and
to the sea.&nbsp; For six years Clerk sequestered in the land of
France, and was caught at last in a tender filial hour when he
had ventured home to see his folk.&nbsp; A squad of the Campbells
found him skulking in the wood of Pennymore on the very afternoon
of his return; he had not even had the time to see his people,
and the trinkets and sweetmeats he had meant for his mother were
strewn from his pockets among the bracken as he was being dragged
before the Lords.</p>
<p>They looked at him&mdash;these dour and exigent
gentlemen&mdash;with eyes that held no pity, not men at all for
the nonce, but bowelless, inexorable legal mechanism; and
Elchies, squeaking like a showman at a fair, sentenced him to the
gallows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Clerk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have had an <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>impartial
trial; you have been defended by an able advocate, who has made
the most of a wretched cause; the jury has found you guilty as
libelled, and it only rests with this court to pronounce sentence
accordingly.&nbsp; You may yet, during the brief period you have
to live, best serve your country and your friends by warning them
against those pernicious principles which have brought you to
this untimely end, and may the Lord have mercy on your
soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the doomster declared doom&mdash;that young John Clerk be
handed over to the Sheriff-Depute, hanged by the neck on the
burgh gibbet at Creag-nan-caoraich on the 5th September, and
thereafter left for a time in chains.</p>
<p>The lad made a bow to his judges, gave a last quick, eager
glance about the court to assure himself his parents were not
there, and then he was hurried down the trap-door to the
cells.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>There
was still a month to go before the day of execution, and the
Clerks of Pennymore&mdash;the proud and bitter dame and her pious
husband&mdash;scoured the shire in search of sympathetic
gentlemen of influence, and forswore sleep itself in their
efforts to secure reprieve.&nbsp; They seemed, poor souls!
miraculous in their great endurance, singly or together tramping
here and there on a quest no neighbour dared to share, tragic to
see upon the highway, horrible to hear at midnight when their
cart went rumbling through the sleeping clachans.&nbsp; Sympathy
was plentiful, but influence was shy, and the hopes of Pennymore
were narrowed at last to Campbell of Lochgair, a lawyer himself,
with the ear of His Grace and the Crown authorities.</p>
<p>Lochgair, more, as it strangely seemed, for the sake of the
peevish dame than for her husband&rsquo;s, promised his active
interest, and almost guaranteed release, and in the latter days
of August went to Edinburgh <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>to wait on the Lord Advocate, who was
Prestongrange.&nbsp; It was the year of the stunted
corn&mdash;1752&mdash;and never in the memory of man had been
such inclement weather.&nbsp; The seas would seem to have
forgotten the ways of peace; the glens were flooded, and the
Highlands for a space were cut off from the Lowland world, and in
a dreary privacy of storm.&nbsp; So the days passed&mdash;for
most folk as if Time itself were bogged among the mire&mdash;for
the man and wife in Pennymore as the flap of wings.&nbsp; They
longed each evening for the morrow since it might bring welcome
news, and yet they grudged the night and looked with terror on
the dawn, since it brought the horrid hour a vigil closer.</p>
<p>And there were no tidings from Lochgair!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known! I might have known!&mdash;a traitor
ever, like his clan!&rdquo; cried the mother, all her patience
drained to the bitter dregs, wringing her hands till the blood
came to the knuckles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lochgair <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>will see the
laddie hanged, and never jee his beaver.&nbsp; Too well I know
his promises!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re here forgot, the pair of us, and
all the world sleeping sound, no way put about at the thought of
young John Clerk.&nbsp; Deserted of men! deserted of men!&rdquo;
and her cry rose like a dirge in their lonely dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not of God and His grace,&rdquo; said her husband,
shrinking before the fury of her eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have trusted
Lochgair in this with all my heart, and he cannot betray
us.&nbsp; He knows that his breath is all that lies between our
laddie and eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, trust!&rdquo; she hissed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ken the
man; but I have trusted too, this fortnight, till my very heart
is rent, yet God Himself cannot put off the 5th
September.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, even that, if it be His will; our times are in His
hands,&rdquo; said the pious husband, and turned him again to his
Bible.&nbsp; But the woman&rsquo;s doubts were <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>justified,
and on the morning of the day before their son should perish,
they yoked the horse and drove in the cart to the burgh town to
see him for the first time in the cell he had shared with some
doomed sheep-stealers.</p>
<p>Six miles lay between their home and the tolbooth gates, and
yet it was in pitch-black night they came to the confines of the
burgh, for they dreaded the pitying eyes of men and women.&nbsp;
And all the way the woman fondled something in her plaid.&nbsp;
They saw, afar, and few, and melancholy, wan lights in the burgh
lands, blurred by the weeping rain; and at this
spectacle&mdash;which told them the world went on its ordinary
way and thought of breakfast, while their lad sat counting the
hours, and they were engaged with misery&mdash;the man put his
hand on the woman&rsquo;s shoulder with a grip of steel, and she
gave the last sob that was ever heard from her.&nbsp; For ever
after she was a woman made of stone.&nbsp; <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>The horse, as
if it shared their feeling, stopped on the highway, reared itself
in terror of something unseen, and snapped its belly-band, and
the cart stood still under heaving beeches whose windy branches
filled the dark with noise and cried down the very waves which
roared on Creag-nan-caoraich.</p>
<p>The man jumped from the cart and fumbled with the harness, to
find that further progress, wanting a girth, was not to be
contemplated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will walk into the town,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
get a rope, if you sit here till I return.&nbsp; You will not
mind my leaving you, Margaret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; she exclaimed with bitterness; &ldquo;I
have learned my lesson, and there is no more to
mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she fondled the thing concealed in her
plaid, and her man walked quickly towards the wan lights of the
tenements, leaving her all alone.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>For a
moment only she heard his footsteps, the sound of them soon lost
in the din of nature&mdash;the uproar of the forest trees, whose
ponderous branches creaked; the wind, canorous, blowing between
the mountains; the booming crepitation of the sea upon the
rocks.&nbsp; And yet no sense of solitude depressed her, for her
mind was occupied by one triumphant thought&mdash;that young John
Clerk should at least be spared the horror and shame of a public
execution.</p>
<p>She had drawn, at first, the drenched plaid over her head to
shield her and shut her in from the noise of tempest; but her
hands in a little while were so busily engaged with her secret
possession that the tartan screen at last rolled back on her
shoulders, and she was aware of another sound than those of
nature&mdash;the near, faint clang of chains.&nbsp; It was
scarcely audible, but unmistakable&mdash;the beat of a loose end
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>of iron
links against wood, somewhere above her head, as she sat in the
cart by the side of Creag-nan-caoraich.&nbsp; She stared up into
the darkness and saw nothing, then stood to her feet and felt
above her with trembling hand.</p>
<p>Her fingers searched along a beam with a rope attached to it,
whose meaning flooded to her brain with a gush that stunned; she
touched a dead man&rsquo;s feet! and the pitiless clouds that had
swept all night across the heavens heaved for a moment from the
face of the reeling moon, and she saw the wretch upon the
gibbet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo; she screamed till the rocks and
trees gave back the echo, and yet the distant lights of the burgh
town glowed on with unconcern.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Her cries had ceased; she was sunk in a listless torpor in the
bottom of the cart when her man returned in a state as wretched
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>as her
own, running with stumbling feet along the rutted highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! my God!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have learned
of something dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned it for myself,&rdquo; said his
wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a day behind the fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one day, but eleven of them,&rdquo; said her
husband, hardly taking her meaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the
fifteenth of September, and I&rsquo;m so fearful of the
worst.&nbsp; I dared not rap at a door in the town and
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fifteenth of September,&rdquo; she repeated dully;
&ldquo;we have not slept so sound this month back that we could
miss a fortnight.&nbsp; Have you lost your reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a placard put up on the mercat
cross,&rdquo; said her husband, with his brow upon the
horse&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I read it in the light of the
tolbooth windows, and it tells that the Government have decreed
that, the day after September 2nd should be September 14th.&nbsp;
Eleven days are dropped; it is called&mdash;it <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>is called the
Gregorian Calendar, and I have forgotten about the
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman harshly laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hearing me, Margaret?&rdquo; he cried, putting
up his arms to seize her, feeling some fresh terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gregorian here, Gregorian there!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose Calendar but the cursed
Campbells&rsquo;, who have bonnily diddled me of my son!&nbsp;
Our times are in God&rsquo;s hands, you said; you are witness now
they are in the devil&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it may be I was right, and that this is our
Father&rsquo;s miracle; John could not be&mdash;could not die but
on the day appointed, and no such day, it seems, was on the
Calendar.&nbsp; But I dared not ask, I dared not ask; I was
dumfounded and ran to you, and here I am even without the
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the woman harshly laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not fash about the rope, good-man,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;at your very hand is <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>plenty for your purpose, for there my
son is, young John Clerk, and he hangs upon the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman would not put a hand upon the body.&nbsp; Without
her aid her husband lowered the burden from the gibbet, laid it
in the cart and covered it with his plaid; and when a girth for
the horse had been improvised from a part of the shameful halter,
the two of them turned for home, walking side by side through the
dawn that now was coming, slow and ashen, to the east.</p>
<p>The man was dumb, and walked without volition, wrestling with
satanic doubts of a Holy Purpose that had robbed him of his son
with such unnecessary and ghastly mockery; the woman cuddled her
cold secret in her bosom, stared glassily at the coming day, and
for a time let fury and despair whirl through her brain like
poison vapours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never rest,&rdquo; she cried at last,
&ldquo;till Lochgair has paid the penalty for this <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>trick upon
us.&nbsp; My laddie&rsquo;s death is at his door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her man said nothing, leading the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At his door!&rdquo; she cried more vehemently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you hearing me?&nbsp; He has slain my son in this
shameful way as surely as if he had tied the rope
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband made no answer; he found in her words but the
thought of one for the time demented, and he walked appalled at
the chaos into which the precious edifice of his faith had
tumbled.&nbsp; Rudely she plucked his arm and screamed in his
ear&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do to Campbell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Campbell?&rdquo; he repeated vaguely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God forgive him his false hopes and negligence, but it was
not he who condemned our son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for him,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;my son would
have died like a gentleman, and not like a common
thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said her husband
blankly.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;No, you never understand,&rdquo; she sneered,
&ldquo;that was ever your failing.&nbsp; Do you think that if I
had not the promise of Lochgair, I should let my laddie die upon
the gallows?&nbsp; The first of his race! the first of his
race!&nbsp; I had brought with me his pistol that he might save
himself the scandal of the doomster&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; and she
took the weapon from her bosom.</p>
<p>Her husband looked at it, grasped at once the Spartan spirit
of her scheme, and swithered between chagrin that it had been
foiled, and shame that the sin of self-slaughter should for a
moment seem desirable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Margaret!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you terrify
me.&nbsp; Throw that dreadful weapon in the sea,&rdquo; and he
made to take it from her, but she restored it to her plaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there may be use for
it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use for it!&rdquo; he repeated, and she poured into his
ear the torrent of her hatred of Lochgair.&nbsp; &ldquo;He could
have won my laddie <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>off,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we had his own
assurance.&nbsp; And if we had not put our trust in him, we would
have gone to others&mdash;Asknish or Stonefield, or the Duke
himself&mdash;the Duke would have had some pity on a
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lochgair may have sore deceived us,&rdquo; said her
husband, &ldquo;yet he was but an instrument; our laddie&rsquo;s
doom was a thing appointed from the start of Time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then from the start of Time you were doomed to slay
Lochgair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; I?&rdquo; quo&rsquo; he,</p>
<p>&ldquo;One or other of us.&nbsp; We are, it seems by your
religion, all in the hands of fate and cannot help
ourselves.&nbsp; Stand up like a man to this filthy Campbell, and
give him the bullet that was meant for a better man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mad, goodwife,&rdquo; said her husband;
&ldquo;I would shed no man&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak not of men,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but of that
false fiend Lochgair who has kept us on the rack, and robbed Time
itself of a fortnight to make his clan diversion.&nbsp; Oh, man!
man! <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>are
you a coward?&nbsp; Challenge him to the moor; remember that at
the worst my son who lies in the cart there could have died in
decency and not at the doomster&rsquo;s hand if Lochgair had not
misled us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; cried her husband, &ldquo;get behind
me!&rdquo; and took refuge in a gust of mumbled prayer.</p>
<p>They were now upon the Kenmore shore where the sea came deep
against the rocks; no living soul had met them on their passage
down the coast with their disgraceful burden, and alarmed at the
prospect of encounter with any curious wayfarer, they drew the
cart behind a thicket, to let an approaching horseman pass
without his observation.&nbsp; Far off they heard the clatter of
his horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and while yet he was a good way distant
the questing eye of the woman saw he wore a beaver hat, and a
familiar coat with silver buttons!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;here comes the
very man, delivered to our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>&ldquo;I will not touch him!&nbsp; I will not touch
him!&rdquo; said her husband, cowering behind the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will I!&rdquo; said she, and drew the pistol from
her breast, and her husband wrestled with her for the weapon.</p>
<p>Lochgair in a furious haste came galloping, his vision engaged
on the road before him, and would have swept on his way
unnoticing the cart, its burden, or attendants, but for the
altercation in the thicket.&nbsp; He checked his horse, turned
round on the saddle, and peered among the branches, where the
husband, breathing hard, had got possession of the weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has slain my son, but I will spare him,&rdquo; said
the husband, and the woman put her mouth against his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No son of yours,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that is
the curse of it!&mdash;but his own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried her husband, and fired at the
horseman&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; He fell like a <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>sack of oats
on the roadway, and his horse flew off among the brackens.</p>
<p>For a while the world seemed in a swound.&nbsp; In a swound
the waves lapped up against the rocks; in a swound the leafage
moved; in a swound the sea-birds cried, and the man and woman,
desperate, sought to hide the evidence of their crime.&nbsp; They
turned the dead man over on his back, emptied his pouches, filled
his clothes with stones, then threw him, with the pistol, in the
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home! home!&rdquo; the wife commanded, placing the dead
man&rsquo;s papers in her plaid, and she walked, without remorse,
by the side of her whimpering man, to Pennymore.&nbsp; She
stirred the embers of the fire, and one by one destroyed the dead
man&rsquo;s documents, until the very last, and that she glanced
at horror-stricken, for it was her son&rsquo;s reprieve!</p>
<p>With a scream she rushed outside and turned her
husband&rsquo;s plaid from the face of the dead man in the
cart&mdash;and it was not young John Clerk!</p>

RETURN TO NATURE.</h2>
<h3><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Highland country is so
peaceful and content, its folk are so staid in welldoing,
property is so safe, and the human passions&mdash;at least the
more savage of them&mdash;are kept so strictly in control, that
most of us forget how lately we rose from the rude condition of
nature.&nbsp; It is really but a brief span of years that
separates us from our fathers who slept with an ear to the
heather, hunted in the forests for their very lives, fought in
stupid causes as heartily as we go football-playing, or forayed
over narrow borders into parts of the country <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>distinguished
from their own but by a difference in the colour of the
tartan.&nbsp; Who thinks of the ancient cateran fire smouldering
under a frock-coat, or would imagine that the cry of
&ldquo;Cruachan!&rdquo; in the ears of a quiet and prosperous
sheep-farmer at a country fair will sometimes splash deep in the
wells of his being, and stir up the red ghosts of war and
vengeance that have not walked for generations?&nbsp; I have seen
that marvel often, though always with new astonishment.&nbsp; I
can amuse myself sometimes by saying one word of great meaning to
the members of a family that has not broken the law since the
year 1745, and see, in a moment, bitterness where before was
indifference, anger in the gentlest girls, and in their brothers
a hate almost as unreasoning and hot as that of Cain.&nbsp; A
flash&mdash;just one flash of the spirit that we do not control,
but with no consent of the flesh&mdash;and then they will laugh
at their own folly.</p>
<p>It was some such flame of the ancient <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>elemental
passions, doubtless, that accounted for the transgression of
Macaulay, the factor of the Captain of Kilree&mdash;an outbreak
of the Islands that I think has had no parallel in the annals of
Scotland for more than a hundred years.&nbsp; I did not know
Macaulay in his prime.&nbsp; When I was a boy he was an ancient,
bent, and spiritless man, with a singularly devout reputation,
and a grim, humorsome Lowland wife; but everybody round the
countryside knew his story, and we boys used to look at him from
afar off, amazed, admiring, and half-incredulous, like children
who have heard tales of giants who could stride from hill to
hill, and have at last been taken to see one in a show.&nbsp; In
his shabby green business suit of broadcloth and beaver hat, or
leaning on his cane at the church gate, with snuff strewn down
his waistcoat, there was nothing at all about his personality to
suggest the terrific and romantic.&nbsp; Maybe, as our elders
used to say, the nose did hint at the eagle, the flaring nostril
say <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>something of the morning sniffed suspiciously among
alders where the skulker hid, a certain twitch of the bushy
eyebrows express a fearful soul that one time stood alone on
hill-tops and saw the whole visible world its enemy; but to our
vision, at least, the man was &ldquo;done,&rdquo; as we say, and
by his look might have been a prosperous weaver in the decline of
years.</p>
<p>Yet he had an experience, the narration of which by our elders
gave him the glory of Rob Roy to our imaginations.&nbsp; He had,
in a sublime hour of his life, burst the bonds that make some of
us fret in the urging weather of spring, that most of us chafe at
in childhood, when the old savage wakes and cries, but grow at
last to tolerate and even cherish; and he had taken the world for
his pillow&mdash;as the Gaelic phrase goes&mdash;and short of the
vital blood of man had dipped in the early sins.</p>
<h3><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>II.</h3>
<p>Alexander Macaulay was his name; in the common conversation of
the people he was known as Alasdair Dhu, or Black Alick, for till
he was nearly seventy his hair was like the bramble-berry.&nbsp;
Of his forebears in the island everybody knew; they had owned
Kincreggan for at least five hundred years, until, in his
grandfather&rsquo;s time, they were proscribed and rendered
fugitive, made Children of the Mist, nameless vagabonds
frequenting desolate straths, making uneasy beds on hunted moors,
their home reft from them more by the quirk of the law than by
valour, and the walls of it grown with nettle and fern on the
verge of the forest of Kilree.&nbsp; Himself he had been brought
up far apart <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>from the scenes of his cateran family, in a decent
humdrum fashion in the Low County, where he had studied the law,
and whence he had come to his native isle a writer.&nbsp; Silent,
they said of him&mdash;silent and dour, except in congenial
company, when his laugh was as ready as any one&rsquo;s, and his
sense of a joke singularly shrewd.&nbsp; Just a plain, douce,
decent lawyer body, given pedantically to the quotation of Latin
maxims affecting his profession; married, as I have said, to a
Lowland wife; his business comfortable, bringing him much about
the Islands in boats and gigs.&nbsp; He was
&ldquo;doer&rdquo;&mdash;which is to say, man of business, or
agent&mdash;for several of the most notable families in the shire
in his later years; but at the time I speak of he was factor for
Kilree alone.</p>
<p>When I have added that he was forty years of age when he had
his odd relapse, could sing a fine bass to the Psalmody on a
Sabbath, was great for books, and thought <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>no hour of
the day so happy as when he could get into his slippers and his
feet on the fender, and drink a dish of tea&mdash;a beverage for
which he had a passion many men have for wine&mdash;I have summed
up all that was apparent to his neighbours in the character of
Alexander Macaulay.&nbsp; And yet they left out a great part of
the real Macaulay in their estimate of the factor of Kilree.</p>
<p>It happened on a dirty wet day in the month of May that Kilree
the Captain himself was on the island, and came to
Macaulay&rsquo;s office to consult regarding some
improvements&mdash;as he esteemed them&mdash;that he had for long
contemplated on the inland side of his estate.&nbsp; He was in
the Army, a good and gallant soul, young and sentimental, with
what is even now common enough in the Highlands and Islands, a
great regard for old romantics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I start at once to put the fence from Cairn Dearg
to Carsaig,&rdquo; said he <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>by-and-by, carelessly walking up and
down Macaulay&rsquo;s room, and looking through the window at the
sea-birds flying noisily along the shore.</p>
<p>The lawyer gave a little start in his armchair, and upset a
bottle of red ink.&nbsp; It was dripping from the desk to his
knees, and he hurriedly swept his hand across the stream of it,
then dashed the flood with sand.&nbsp; &ldquo;To Carsaig, did you
say?&rdquo; he asked, taking up his penknife in his reddened hand
and nervously starting to shape a quill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Captain, suspecting nothing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s slipping past, and I&rsquo;m determined to
put off no longer carrying out my father&rsquo;s old notion of
having the fence as far as the two rivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Kincreggan?&rdquo; asked the lawyer,
suddenly grown the colour of clay, but sitting still at his desk,
his eyes on his reddened hand, some strange freak of the fancy,
as he used to say in after years, filling his head with the salt
scent <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>of
blood.&nbsp; Kincreggan, his people&rsquo;s home before they were
broken, and tenants of the mist alone, was in a little glen of
Carsaig.&nbsp; In his mind in a moment he saw it perched above
its waters, empty and cold and grey, with only memory under its
rotting rafters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kincreggan!&nbsp; Damn Kincreggan!&rdquo; said the
Captain, quite forgetting that ever a Macaulay was bred
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kincreggan comes down, of course; I&rsquo;m
going to put a shepherd&rsquo;s cottage there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you will pull down Kincreggan House,&rdquo; cried
the lawyer, jumping to his feet so suddenly that his chair upset
behind him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kincreggan!&rdquo; he repeated, with a
kind of whimper; and the Captain turned sharply round at the
strangeness of the cry, and saw another man than his customary
factor&mdash;a fellow all thong in every sinew of his neck and
face, his hair tossed on his temples, his arms strained back, and
a bloody hand clenched, his whole body stiff <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>as if he were
about to spring.&nbsp; And his eyes were wells of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! what cat-a-mountain have I here in Alasdair
Macaulay?&rdquo; thought the Captain, startled, and then
remembered whose Kincreggan had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kincreggan!&rdquo; said the lawyer again, and followed
with a phrase of the Gaelic language that he had never been known
to speak since he left the island, a child, for Edinburgh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;but I
clean forgot the old connection!&nbsp; How was I to know my
factor had the least objection?&nbsp; Come, come, Mr Macaulay, we
cannot permit a foolish old sentiment about a ruin of stones to
stand in the way of honest improvement.&nbsp; It is not as if
Kincreggan was a castle or a cathedral.&nbsp; I have my own
repugnances about spoiling old landmarks, but
Kincreggan&mdash;!&nbsp; Come, come, Mr Macaulay, what scruple
need there be about a place like yon!&nbsp; Beyond yourself <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>there is not
a single soul of the old breed left, and you never saw a fire in
it&mdash;no, nor your father before you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No miracle imaginable could have surprised him more than
this&mdash;that a plain man of the law in broadcloth in a
carpeted office, with a pile of black deed-boxes behind him, and
the statutes of the land calf-bound on a shelf at his elbow, a
pen in his hand, and a fob-chain dangling below his waistcoat,
could have so remarkable a sentiment about an old ruin as these
dramatics of his seemed to suggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! Mr Macaulay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye need not
make any fracas about it now, for Mackay has his orders, and
starts at Kincreggan immediately; the roof will be off in a day
or two.&nbsp; And as for these silly clan sentiments, I have lost
money by them ere this: I will let them influence me no more; I
do not value them that, Mr Macaulay!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so saying,
he cracked his fingers in his factor&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Alasdair Dhu felt his blood boil in his head till his
skull seemed like to burst; the stain on his hand enlarged to a
crimson cloud that filled the chamber, as he used in later years
to say himself, and a strange roaring came into his ears.&nbsp;
Suddenly he gave the cry of his clan, ran up against Kilree, and
with the penknife stabbed him in the bosom.</p>
<p>Without a pause so little as to look at the victim of his
frenzy, he passed quickly into his house, whereof his writing
chamber was a part.&nbsp; His wife sat sewing.&nbsp; He looked at
her with an ecstasy in his eyes: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick-tired of
this,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;my grief! but I have been wasting
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so saying, he turned on his heel and ran
out to the garden behind the house.&nbsp; Knowing nothing of the
Captain&rsquo;s state, she ran out after her husband, and saw him
leap the wall like a young roe.&nbsp; His clerk, a lad Macdonald,
was out in the garden for peats for the office fire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look at your master!&rdquo; <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>she cried, and together they watched
the lawyer throw off his coat as he ran, and disappear at last in
the fir planting on the other side of the road, whence it rose on
the face of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a caper!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tut!
tut!&mdash;he&rsquo;s daft&mdash;clean daft!&nbsp; I always
thought there was a lot of his grandfather, Ranald, in him.&nbsp;
And such a day!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll get wet to the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>III.</h3>
<p>Kincreggan is in a cleft of the mountain where the River Glas
is joined by the Water of Maam, its situation chosen with cunning
for that purpose it used so well to serve.&nbsp; For weeks after
the lawyer had ludicrously cast off his coat on the highway and
disposed of his trews in the planting behind his office, and was
seen making for Kilree forest wrapped ingeniously in a web of
tartan filched from a weaver&rsquo;s waulking-wicker, Kincreggan,
for all the Isles, at least, was the most interesting place in
the world.&nbsp; People quitted work, put on their Sabbath
clothes, and came a long day&rsquo;s journey to see it, not
approaching it by the narrow pass that led to its front walls,
but laboriously climbing the hills from whose tops <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>they could in
safety get a view of the old place where there had so suddenly
flared up fires dead two hundred years.</p>
<p>What they saw&mdash;all they could see&mdash;was a grey
whinstone tower built extraordinarily with its back against Cnoc
Dearg, a red precipice hundreds of feet high, a gable and front
to the very edge of the rock that hung over a deep dark pool made
by the falls at the fork of the rivers, its main gable opening on
the cattle-fold and the pass that gave the only entrance to
Kincreggan.&nbsp; They saw a place as ill to storm as though it
crowned a mountain, a place devised strictly for hours of
war&mdash;but still a beautiful place, wherein a person of fancy
might be content to dwell for ever as in a petty kingdom, the
fish of the pool his, the birds that clucked or sang in the alder
thickets round the fold at the mountain foot, the deer that came
down for the sun of the afternoon, the cattle that lowed in the
pen.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>And
Alasdair Dhu had the cattle!&nbsp; The people could see them
plainly from the hill, and in certain puffs of the spring wind
hear their <i>geumnaich</i>&mdash;the sad complaint that Highland
kyloes make on strange pastures, remembering the sweeter taste of
the grass of home.&nbsp; The cattle were Kilree&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
They had gone from his hill at night as by magic, and in the
morning they were in Kincreggan fold, where stolen herds were
harboured before the old Macaulays went into the mist, and where
there had not been a hoof in four generations.&nbsp; With the
cattle, furthermore, went missing a number of muskets from the
armoury of Kilree.&nbsp; Macaulay the lawyer was back at his
forefathers&rsquo; business!</p>
<p>The first thing a man to-day would do in the like
circumstances would be to call for the police; but even to-day,
in the Islands, the police are rare and remote from Kilree, and
at that time it was as ill to reach them as to reach St Kilda,
even <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>had
there been no popular conviction that the civil law alone is all
that a Highland gentleman can with propriety call into
action.&nbsp; So Kilree for a while did nothing but nurse his
wound, and Macaulay lurked in his fastness alone, no one&mdash;by
the Captain&rsquo;s orders&mdash;lifting a hand against
him.&nbsp; But the stabbing of his master and the lifting of his
bestial were only the start of his escapade, which became the
more astonishing after his clerk, the lad Macdonald, out of
Moidart, was sent to him on a curious mission.</p>
<p>Macdonald was a fellow without fear, and it must be added,
without brains either, otherwise he might never have done a thing
that made all the Isles laugh at him when they heard later what
he had carried, and another thing that bears out my premiss that
the primitive man is immediately below a good many well-laundered
modern shirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could bring that madman of mine to his
senses,&rdquo; Macaulay&rsquo;s wife said to the clerk one
day.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>&ldquo;The sooner the better, then,&rdquo; said
Macdonald, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s much to do before the rent
collection.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke as if his master were only out
upon a drinking-bout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I just had him here for ten minutes!&rdquo; said Mrs
Macaulay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might&mdash;you might venture to go to Kincreggan
and see him,&rdquo; suggested the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have more regard for my life,&rdquo; said the
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ower much of the Lowlander to trust
myself in a den with a mad Highlander&mdash;even if he&rsquo;s my
own man.&nbsp; Forbye&rdquo; (here she smiled), &ldquo;forbye,
I&rsquo;ve tried it already.&nbsp; I have been twice at
Kincreggan in the early morning, and he kept me fifty yards off
the walls with his gun.&nbsp; But I would not care to have that
mentioned in the place; it&rsquo;s perhaps as little to my credit
as to his own.&nbsp; Oh, if I had him under this roof again for
ten minutes, or could get a certain thing delivered in his
hands&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She broke off, and looked <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>into
Macdonald&rsquo;s face quickly as with an inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little packet,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;just a
small packet you could carry in your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buidseachas</i>&mdash;I mean witchcraft?&rdquo; said
Macdonald, who had brought a good many superstitions from
Moidart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well&mdash;in a way, a sort of witchcraft,&rdquo;
she admitted, with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is part of a charm
that wiles men from their wild ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what I might risk taking it to
him, then,&rdquo; said Macdonald, and so it happened that that
very evening he found himself challenged fifty yards from the
wall of Kincreggan, with a pair of slippers wrapped carefully in
paper in his hands&mdash;nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you there, Macdonald?&rdquo; cried the
master, girning over the neck of a musket at his clerk, who shook
on the <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>edge of the river at the narrowest part of the pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; was the lad&rsquo;s answer, for
indeed his knowledge of what he carried was due to his own
curiosity and not to any information he had got from the lady who
sent him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not know; I was sent with it by your
wife, Mr Macaulay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kincreggan, you mean,&rdquo; corrected the factor,
plainly determined on the old territorial honours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kincreggan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop it into the pool, then,&rdquo; commanded the
madman, snuggling closer to his weapon, and Macdonald did as he
was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come in and I will speak to you,&rdquo; said
Macaulay, and so the clerk got into Kincreggan, and however his
master coaxed or cozened him, he stayed there.</p>
<p>For some days after the cracking of guns was heard echoing for
miles round the hollow of Kincreggan.&nbsp; That sent the island
mad with an itching curiosity.&nbsp; On all the <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>roads men and
women travelled, and up the face of Ben Buidhe, to lie on the
myrtle and look at Alasdair Dhu and his clerk shooting and
fishing as in the fine free ancient days.&nbsp; It was no secret
that many admired the outlaw; his state of nature seemed so
enviable compared with their own poor prosaic lives as fishers or
shepherds, that he might have had recruits if he had been more
accessible.&nbsp; The people were vexed for the Captain, it is
true, but not so vexed that they could not admire the cleverness
of the man who, bred in towns and brought up to the pen, had
lifted the laird&rsquo;s cattle as neatly as if he had tramped a
lifetime through night and mist with his forebears.&nbsp; They
got a new light upon society and its rights and wrongs, though
they might not have the philosophy to explain it clearly; they
seemed to see that might was right at any time; they searched
themselves in vain to see wherein Macaulay and his clerk,
possessing themselves of <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Macaulay&rsquo;s ancient home and of
things not made with hands, but nature&rsquo;s gifts, were any
worse than the long line of Kilree&rsquo;s family that, ending in
the Captain himself, had used cunning and contrivance to get and
keep these things.&nbsp; It was said that a kind of fever went
through the men when they saw the example of Macaulay, that they
abandoned their common tasks awhile, and might, but for mothers
and wives, have gone wholly wrong.</p>
<p>The Captain was no sooner out of his doctor&rsquo;s hands than
he sent a corps of his workmen to expel the outlaws and pull down
Kincreggan House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hardly
angry at the fellow for his mischievousness; it takes so uncommon
a form.&nbsp; He might have robbed me all these years decently
like a man of business in quite another fashion far less
interesting.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s madness, of course, but it&rsquo;s
in a lot of blood that runs very sluggishly in these parts
nowadays.&nbsp; I <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>sometimes have had a touch of it myself; so I&rsquo;ll
give the rogue law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to Kincreggan, then, went his men with picks, and the first
of them had only got round the bend of the pass when a bullet
flew over his head and another close behind it.&nbsp; The lawyer
and his clerk were determined to hold Kincreggan as Ranald More
Macaulay had held it against the Captain&rsquo;s grandfather!</p>
<p>Next the Captain himself went up, and reached as far as the
wall of the fold where his own cattle were imprisoned.&nbsp; A
cry stopped him at the wall, and he looked up to see the pieces
of Macaulay and the lad directed at his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A parley, Kincreggan!&rdquo; he cried, slyly giving his
late factor the honour.</p>
<p>The lawyer was hard to recognise, so oddly had he changed from
the shaven and well-put-on man of business who had plied an
industrious quill but lately at a desk.&nbsp; A beard blackened
his face; the <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>pilfered web of tartan was belted round his loins into a
kilt, with the end of it dragged round his shoulder for a plaid
in the fashion of the age of Mar; a blue bonnet was scrugged down
upon his brow, and on his feet, that used to enjoy the slippers
of his own fireside, were <i>cuarains</i>&mdash;roughly-made
moccasins of ox-hide with the hair still on them.&nbsp; It was,
to the eye and imagination of the Captain, as if time and change
had someway overlooked the shelter of Kincreggan in its mountain
cleft, and there had remained in it, unknown and unsuspected,
some eddying backwater of the wild old days.&nbsp; In faith,
Macaulay in such an ancient polity had been a chief of chiefs; he
had it in his aspect and his mien.&nbsp; He stood against the
crenels of a bastion, his whole figure revealed, an elbow on the
stones and the musket balanced in his hands, a kind of lazy
elegance in his attitude, ease and independence, health and
pride.&nbsp; He looked at his old client as an eagle might look
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>at a lamb,
swithering whether he should swoop or stay still.&nbsp; The only
thing to mar the dignity of the picture was the presence of his
clerk in an angle of the wall besides him&mdash;still the
&rsquo;prentice lawyer, doubtless even to the ink on the very
finger that hung on the trigger of the weapon with which he
covered the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be giving you three minutes, Kilree,&rdquo; said
Macaulay, &ldquo;to get the length of the boulder yonder on your
way back.&nbsp; If I see so much as your heel after that I will
shoot at it, and you will not escape with your life a second
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very fine, and I&rsquo;ll not deny it is
picturesque,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a
little out of date and a cursed folly.&nbsp; More than that,
it&rsquo;s robbery, to say nothing about the&mdash;the accident
with the knife, and nowadays there&rsquo;s admitted to be no
grace about a robbery even committed in a kilt.&nbsp; It might be
all very well for your <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>grandfather and my own to fight like
this over these walls, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Kincreggan come into the hands of your
family?&rdquo; interrupted the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have me there,&rdquo; admitted the Captain, with a
little awkward laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have me there, and
I&rsquo;m not a lawyer to obscure the facts.&nbsp; Our folk
fought yours for it, and having got it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the fighting was not finished,&rdquo; said the
outlaw; &ldquo;I have begun it again, and Kincreggan is
Macaulay&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Go back, Kilree, go back; and if you come
again, bring a coffin under your arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain went, and it was the last he was to see of his
factor till that stormy Lammas day when the outlaw came home.</p>
<p>Macaulay roved the moors and forest while his clerk kept ward
in their fortress.&nbsp; Stags fell to his gun, the best linns
gave him fish.&nbsp; At the market in Marinish, over the ford on
the other island, where the <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Captain&rsquo;s clan was unpopular,
Macaulay one day appeared at a cattle tryst and sold beasts the
buyers did not inquire too closely about, and he replaced them in
his fold with others lifted boldly from Kilree&rsquo;s home farm
on his way back from the market.&nbsp; Night and day he was
watched for, but night or day either he or Macdonald was awake
and waiting; and more than once he was at the other end of the
parish on some exploit while Kilree&rsquo;s men kept an eye on
the pass.</p>
<p>He became the glory of his own island, and a toast at fairs in
all the Islands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alasdair Dhu&rdquo; was the name on
every lip; his wife shared his popularity, and people sent her
gifts of sheep and fowl from as far as the mainland.&nbsp; And
all she would say was, &ldquo;What a silly thing!&nbsp; An island
of men against one man in a dream!&nbsp; If I had just had him
here!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>IV.</h3>
<p>The Captain, who had been with his corps in the Lowlands, came
home, thought hard, and made a plan.&nbsp; &ldquo;If my factor is
so fond of nature, I must fight him with that same,&rdquo; he
said, and for two weeks before Lammas he had every man in his
service building a dam below the pass of Kincreggan.&nbsp; It was
so clever a way of getting the better of Alasdair Dhu that the
men who admired him most now turned most readily to spoil
him.&nbsp; They cut down big firs on either side of the pass, so
that the trees fell over and jammed between the cliffs.&nbsp;
When the pile was high enough they backed it up with brushwood
and turf till it looked like a lofty wall.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking that will do now,&rdquo; said
the Captain when it was done.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us have the first
of the floods of Lammas, and you will see a rat come squealing
from his hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the dam was finished it was dry weather, the river at the
pass a trickle; but the Captain&rsquo;s own luck was with him,
for the very next day a storm burst on the Islands.&nbsp; He went
to the top of Ben Buidhe, and joined the folk there who were
looking down on Kincreggan.&nbsp; They saw a spectacle!&nbsp; The
river, pit-black in its linns and cream-white in its falls,
gulped down the narrow gorge as if all the waters of the world
were hasting there; the cliff above the keep was streaming, the
path to the house was flooded, the cattle were belly-deep in the
fold, and bellowed mournfully.&nbsp; Every minute saw the water
perceptibly rise till it lay like a loch deep about Kincreggan
House.&nbsp; By the time the gloaming came on the glen the water
washed the lintels of the lower storey.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dour rat, by my troth!&rdquo; said
the Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought we would have heard squealing
by this time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shook the rain from his plaid, and
set off for home.&nbsp; Some say he was heedless of
Macaulay&rsquo;s fate; others more plausibly argue that he knew
very well Macaulay had friends on the hillside who would rescue
him when the need arose.</p>
<p>However it was Macaulay got out of his trap, he got out by
himself, with his clerk behind him.&nbsp; The lad ran over the
island, took a boat to Arisaig, and never came back again; the
factor reached the door of his home at dark an amazing figure in
drenched and savage garments, with a dirk lying flat against the
brawn of his bare arm.&nbsp; He burst upon his wife like a
calamity, but she never blenched.&nbsp; The kettle hung upon its
chain; with a thrust of her foot she swung it over the fire, and
rose to her feet to put a hand on the shoulder of her soaking
lord.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;Oh, Alick! come in, come in!&rdquo; she said, and
so mighty he looked and strange in the room that had known the
decent lawyer, it seemed to her as if he filled it.&nbsp; The
river ran from his garments, and when he moved, the hides on his
feet sucked upon the flooring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me at Kilree the Captain is here,&rdquo; he
said, looking uplifted about him, keeping the blade of his weapon
out of her sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is just come,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and is in
front there, keeping your place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A devilish satisfaction betrayed itself in Macaulay&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have tasted life,&rdquo; he said, stretching
out his arms, and gloating, as it seemed, upon himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have tasted life, and I would not change with
kings!&nbsp; All the clan cries in me, and I am proud,
proud!&nbsp; But there is one thing wanting: I will make sure of
him this time,&rdquo; and saying that, he flourished the dirk and
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>made for
the door that led to his writing chamber.</p>
<p>His wife gave a cry, and put herself before him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, Alick!&rdquo; she said, as calm as she could be,
&ldquo;you are very wet; at least you will first of all put on
dry hose and take a dish of tea,&rdquo; pushing him gently at the
same time towards his accustomed chair.&nbsp; He fondled his
weapon, and sat in the humour of one who is willing to put off a
pleasure that it may be greater by delay.&nbsp; She plucked the
<i>cuarains</i> from his feet and put on him hose and slippers,
all in a nervous haste, and the slippers were no sooner on his
feet than he shook himself, looked with disgust on his drenched
tartan, and threw the dirk away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what cantrip is
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have a dish of tea,&rdquo; said the wife,
hurriedly preparing it; and he wriggled <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>his toes in
the slippers and sat closer to the fire, cherishing its warmth
with that accustomed manner he forgot the day he went
astray.&nbsp; Again and again he looked at himself, and, sipping
the tea, &ldquo;What a folly!&nbsp; What a folly!&rdquo; he would
utter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What put such mischief in my brain?&nbsp; And
we were over head and ears with business at the office!&nbsp; I
must work night and day if I am to be ready for the rents.&nbsp;
Young Macdonald, too!&nbsp; Tut, tut! the thing was fair
ridiculous!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m black affronted.&nbsp; Flora, woman,
haste ye and get my breeks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discarded broadcloth was put out; he sheared and shaved
himself before the glass till the wild man of the mountain was
gone, and emerged the lawyer, then walked into his writing
chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Captain,&rdquo; he said briskly to his
client, just as if he had been out for an airing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This has been a stupid business&mdash;a remarkably stupid
business.&nbsp; I <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>must crave your pardon.&nbsp; At such an inconvenient
time, too!&nbsp; But I hope to make it up some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain could scarcely trust his senses.&nbsp; He had
risen to defend himself against the savage, and here was his
sober man of business back!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it has been what might be called a fairly busy
summer with us, Mr Macaulay,&rdquo; said the Captain, at his
wits&rsquo; end how to meet so curious a penitent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I have still got a twinge of your penknife in my
breast now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The factor&rsquo;s face reddened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare,
I&rsquo;m affronted,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;With a
penknife!&nbsp; Tut, tut!&mdash;a villainously silly weapon,
Captain; and still it might have been a serious enough thing for
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m beat to understand it; some lesion of the
brain, as the medical jurisprudists say; I would never harm a
cat, except <i>durante furore</i>&mdash;if&mdash;if I deliberated
on it.&nbsp; I have little doubt I&rsquo;m the talk of the
country&mdash;most <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>annoying, most annoying!&nbsp; I should not wonder if
the profession made it the occasion of a complaint against me;
and if it come to that, sir, I hope I may look for your
support?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up his penknife again&mdash;it still lay on his
desk&mdash;and the Captain stood back from him abruptly, but he
need not have done so, for the lawyer was only going to sharp his
pen, as benign and proper a man as ever charged a fee.&nbsp; His
client did not know whether to laugh or storm.&nbsp; He felt like
to laugh at the ludicrousness of the way Macaulay had returned to
his senses; he felt anger with the unaccountable spirit which
made the offender more perturbed about the figure he must
henceforth cut in public than that he should for a summer have
played the part of robber, and wellnigh been a murderer
too.&nbsp; But the good humour of Kilree prevailed, and he
laughed&mdash;a demonstration that but visibly increased
Macaulay&rsquo;s chagrin.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;It is no laughing affair, I assure you&mdash;at
least for me,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I am six months
behind with my work, and I doubt not all my correspondents
furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Macaulay and I between us have made shift to deal
with the correspondence in your&mdash;in your holiday,&rdquo;
said the laird.&nbsp; &ldquo;The most serious thing, I&rsquo;m
thinking, is a drove of cattle sold by Alasdair Dhu at Marinish
tryst; I&rsquo;m too poor a man to afford the loss of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not lose a penny,&rdquo; said Macaulay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I got the best of prices for them, and have the money
now.&nbsp; It was an irregularity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So one might call it,&rdquo; agreed the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an irregularity, a sudden craze.&nbsp; If I had
been a man who drank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would probably have drowned the flame of folly long
before now,&rdquo; said the Captain, who sometimes took a
dram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A flame, exactly!&nbsp; Just a flame; no <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>word better
describes it.&nbsp; When you spoke of taking down that rotten
den, I was for the time possessed.&nbsp; I can honestly tell you
that a score of thoughts came sweeping through me that I never
harboured for a second in my life before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor had intruded on you before, eh, Macaulay?&rdquo;
said the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that is neither here nor there; if every man
confessed the thoughts his better nature rejected we were all
condemned for the gallows sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I was looking for a little more contrition,
Mr Macaulay,&rdquo; said the Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
allow the escapade was a little unusual, and not without some
inconvenience to myself?&nbsp; You seem to take it in so odd a
spirit that I cannot be sure against a recurrence.&nbsp; I may
tell you that I&rsquo;m determined to have Kincreggan
down&mdash;I can be as dour as yourself, you see&mdash;and though
I might be prepared to fight the point of its ownership once in
the old <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>fashion, I cannot guarantee that I should be ready for
that a second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word!&rdquo; said Macaulay hastily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My position was ridiculous in law and equity.&nbsp; <i>Ne
dominia rerum sint incerta neve lites sint
perpetu&aelig;</i>&mdash;even if your folk had held the place for
only forty years instead of two hundred, your claim would be
unassailable, as I&rsquo;m prepared to contest in any court in
the land.&nbsp; Kincreggan, Captain&mdash;pooh!&nbsp; I esteem
the place so little that upon my word I would not grudge to put
powder to it myself.&nbsp; And, if you will permit me, I&rsquo;ll
take my desk again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kilree rose from the lawyer&rsquo;s seat with a chuckle, and
Macaulay, indicating another, sank into his old chair with a sigh
of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to ask you one thing,&rdquo; said the
Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did it feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer flushed over his clean-shaven face and stared
straight in front of him <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>out of the window at the sea-shore
with the wild gulls flying free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it is the last time so shameful an affair will
call for reference,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell
you this, it was&mdash;it was an ecstasy!&nbsp; I would not have
lost the experience for ten thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor have it again for twice ten thousand,&rdquo;
concluded the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know this?&rdquo; said the Captain, taking a
grip of his arm and speaking softly into his ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you know this?&nbsp; By heavens, I envy you!&nbsp; What broke the
spell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but I&rsquo;m not going to tell you,&rdquo;
said the lawyer shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&nbsp; It is hardly worth while swallowing
the rump and retching at the tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between ourselves, then,&rdquo; replied Macaulay,
&ldquo;it was my slippers.&nbsp; That and an indifferent dish of
tea.&nbsp; If my wife had <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>not got me into my slippers, neither
you nor I would be sitting so jocular here.&nbsp; The freedom of
the mountains is not to be compared with a pair of dry hose and
content beside the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the Captain grimaced.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I had not asked you.&nbsp; I expected a
miracle, and you give me only an epitome of
civilisation.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>THE
BROOCH.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Wanlock</span> of Manor looked with a
puckered face at the tiny jewel flaming in the hollow of his
hand, and, for the hour forswearing piety, cursed the lamented
Lady Grace, his sister, <i>haut en bas</i>, with all the fury of
his bitter disappointment.&nbsp; The harridan had her
revenge!&nbsp; Last night he dreamt her envoys by their wailings
made the forest hideous; already amongst the Shadows of the
monstrous other world she must be chuckling (if the Shades have
laughter) through her toothless gums at the chagrin of her
brother, for the first of the seven shocks of evil fortune had
that moment staggered him, and he was smitten to the vitals in
his purse and pride.</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>The
brooch, so wretchedly inadequate as consolation for the legacy he
had long anticipated, had seemed last night as he peered at it
with dubious eyes a bauble wholly innocent, and he had laughed at
its sinister reputation, which in a last vagary of her spiteful
humour she had been at pains to apprise him of in a posthumous
private letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seven shocks of dire disaster, and
the last the worst,&rdquo; he had read in the crabbed writing of
the woman who, even in prosperity, could never pardon him his
luckless speculation with the money that was meant to be her
dowry; he had sneered at her pagan folly, but now the
premonstration bore a different aspect; he was stunned with the
news that his law-plea with Paul Mellish of The Peel was lost,
and that the bare expenses of that long-protracted fight should
cost him all that was left of his beggared fortunes.&nbsp; But
that was not the worst of it, for Mellish, as in pity of a
helpless foe, had waived his admitted <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>claim to the swampy field which was
the object of their litigation.&nbsp; The first blow, surely,
with a vengeance!</p>
<p>For a moment Wanlock, now assured of some uncanny essence in
the jewel, thought to defend himself by its immediate
destruction, and then he had a craftier inspiration.&nbsp; He
strode across the room, threw up the window-sash, and bellowed
upon Stephen, his idle son, the spoiled monopolist of what love
he had to spare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see this brooch?&rdquo; he said when the lad, with
a grey dog at his heels, came in with a rakish swagger from his
interrupted dalliance with the last maid (so to call her) left of
Wanlock&rsquo;s retinue.</p>
<p>They looked at it together as it lay in the father&rsquo;s
hand&mdash;a garnet, cut <i>en cabochon</i>, smoothly rounded
like a blob of claret by the lapidary, clasped by thin gold
claws; and the dog, with eyes askance, stood near them, wrapt in
cogitations of a different world.&nbsp; Their heads went down
upon the <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>gem: they stared in silence, strangely influenced by
its eye-like shape and sullen glow, that seemed to come less from
the polished surface than from a cynic spirit inward,
animate.&nbsp; It had the look of age: had glowed on the breasts
of high-scarfed dandies, pinned the screens on girlish bosoms
flat now in the dust, known the dear privacies of love and
passion, lurked in the dusk of treasuries, kept itself unspotted,
indifferent, unchanged through the flux of human
generations.&nbsp; Lord! that men&rsquo;s lives should be so
short and the objects of their fashioning so permanent!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be braw, but it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; very
bonny,&rdquo; at the last quo&rsquo; Stephen Wanlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want ye,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;to take it
now with&mdash;with my assurance of regard and&mdash;and
gratitude to Mellish of The Peel.&nbsp; He has a craze for such
gewgaws, with no small part of his money, they tell me, sunk in
their collection.&nbsp; You can say it has the reputation of a
charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Young
Wanlock posted off on this pleasant mission, with a chuck below
the chin for the maid in passing; and his father, walking in the
afternoon between the dishevelled shrubberies of his neglected
policies, felt at times amid the anguish of his situation a
soothing sense of other ills averted and transferred to one whom
now he hated worse than ever.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It seemed next day as if the evil genius dwelling in the jewel
wrought its purpose with appalling expedition.&nbsp; Something is
in the air of our haunted North whose beaked sea promontories
cleave the wind and foam, that carries the hint of things
impending to all who have boding fears or hateful speculations,
and Wanlock knew some blow had fallen on his enemy while yet were
no human tidings.&nbsp; The pyots chattered garrulous as women on
the walls; the rooks that flew across the grey storm-bitten
country were in clanging bands, possessed of <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>rumours
which they shared at first with the careering clouds alone, for
men are the last of all created things to learn of their own
disasters.</p>
<p>He went eagerly out and came on other harbingers.&nbsp; A
horseman galloped down the glen&mdash;&ldquo;The Peel!&nbsp; The
Peel!&rdquo; he cried, as he thundered past with his head across
his shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;They have broken The Peel!&rdquo;&nbsp;
A running gipsy with a mountain of shining cans a-clatter on his
back skulked into the wood as Wanlock came upon him, and harried
forth by the dog, stood on the highway wildly protesting
innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who blamed ye?&rdquo; queried Wanlock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare to my God I know nothing of it!&rdquo; cried
the man in an excess of apprehension, &ldquo;but The Peel, they
say, was broken into through the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! say ye so!&rdquo; said Wanlock, kindling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The wicked flee when no man pursueth: ye run gey fast, I
think, for innocence,&rdquo; and <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>he fixed a piercing gaze upon the
wretch, who drew his hand across his throat and held it up to
heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is none of my affair&mdash;begone!&rdquo; said
Wanlock, and the gipsy clattered on his way.</p>
<p>Wanlock leaned upon his cane, with the grey dog at his heels,
and let the exultation of the tidings well through all his
being.&nbsp; The woods were sombre round about him: silent and
sad, bereft of voices, for it was the summer&rsquo;s end, and
birds were grieving their departed children.&nbsp; And yet not
wholly still, the forest, for in its dark recesses something
unexpressive moved and muttered.&nbsp; His joy ebbed out, his new
mistrusts beset him; with a wave of the hand he sent the dog
among the undergrowth, and when it disappeared, there rose among
the tangle of the wood an eerie call, indefinite, despondent,
like a dirge.&nbsp; Had the land itself a voice and memory of a
golden age of sunshine and eternal Spring, thus might it be
lamenting.&nbsp; But still&mdash;but still &rsquo;twas not <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>a voice of
nature, rather to the ear of Wanlock like the utterance of a
creature lost in some strange country looking for home and
love.&nbsp; So call the fallen angels in the interspace,
remembering joys evanished.</p>
<p>A hand fell on the listener&rsquo;s shoulder: he flinched and
turned to look in the face of his daughter Mirren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo; she asked him,
breathing deeply, with a wan and troubled aspect.</p>
<p>He held up an arresting hand, and &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;there is something curious in the wood. . . .&nbsp; Did ye
not hear it?&nbsp; Something curious in the wood. . . .&nbsp; In
the wood. . . .&nbsp; Did ye not . . . did ye not hear it?&rdquo;
and his head sank down upon his shoulders; his eyes went questing
through the columns of the trees.</p>
<p>Again the cry rose, farther in the distance, burdened with a
sense of desolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bittern,&rdquo; said Mirren; &ldquo;it can only be a
bittern.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;Do ye think I have not thought of that?&rdquo;
asked Wanlock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have ye ever heard a bittern boom at
this time of the year, and in the middle of the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard it once or twice at night of late,&rdquo;
said his daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;It can only be a bittern, or some
other creature maybe wounded.&nbsp; Do you know that The Peel has
been plundered?&nbsp; Last night the strong-room was broken
into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And robbed of the Mellish jewels?&rdquo; broke in
Wanlock, with exultant intuition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a great collection of antique gems entrusted
to Mellish for the purpose of a monograph he was writing,&rdquo;
said the daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A monograph?&rdquo; asked Wanlock, still with eyes bent
on the wood from which the dog returned indifferent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a book on gems he has been busy
writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wanlock sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;A book!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking he&rsquo;d be better at some other <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>business.&nbsp; I find, myself, but the one Book
needful; all the others are but vanity, and lead but to
confusion.&nbsp; And he was pillaged, was he?&nbsp; Well,
there&rsquo;s this, it might have been a man who could afford it
less, for Mellish was the wealthiest in the shire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now he is the poorest,&rdquo; said the girl with
pity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told it means his utter
ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the money of the Glasfurd girl to patch
his broken fortune with; they&rsquo;re long enough engaged if the
clash of the countryside be true,&rdquo; said Wanlock, and his
daughter blenched, while the wailing cry rose up again beyond the
fir-tops on the moorland edge.</p>
<p>Wanlock stood confused a moment, then seized her by the
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would ye have me vexed for him?&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I&mdash;with your permission&mdash;look upon
it as a dispensation.&nbsp; If Mellish is ruined, Dreghorn is the
richest man in the countryside and the better match for
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;Dreghorn!&rdquo; cried the girl with
scorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;He danced at my mother&rsquo;s
wedding&mdash;a cankered, friendless miser!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now he&rsquo;ll dance at yours!&nbsp; There have
been men more spendthrift, I&rsquo;ll admit, but you&rsquo;re not
a Wanlock if in that respect ye could not teach him better.&nbsp;
He was at me again for ye yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mirren put her fingers in her ears; she was used to these
importunities; they had lately made her days and nights unhappy,
and sent her fleeing like a wild thing to the hills, or roving
with a rebel heart in all the solitary places of the
valley.&nbsp; At any other hour this spirit would have made him
furious; to-day he was elated at her news, and let her go.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>His joy, however, was but transitory.&nbsp; Searching with a
candle late that evening through his wine-cellar among dusty bins
whose empty niches gloomily announced the ebbing tide of that red
sea of pleasure, or <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>its fictitious wave, that had swept
so high on ancient jovial nights to the lips of many generations
of the guests of Manor, a yellow glint as from a reptile&rsquo;s
eye fastened upon him from a cobwebbed corner.&nbsp; He stared at
it in horror and unbelief, closed in upon it with his guttering
candle, warily; and found himself once more the owner of the
brooch!</p>
<p>In the chill of the vault he felt, for a moment, the
convulsion of a mind confronted with some vast mysterious power
whose breath was loathsome, deathly, redolent of dust and fraught
with retribution, and fearing an actual presence, almost shrieked
when the flame of his candle was extinguished in the draught of a
slowly opening door.&nbsp; He stood all trembling, with the jewel
in his hand: a mocking chuckle rose in the outer night: all the
old eerie tales of childhood then were true!&nbsp; He heard
approaching cautious footsteps; a light was struck; a taper
flared, and he faced the ne&rsquo;er-do-well, his son!</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&ldquo;At the wine again, Stephen?&rdquo; he said with
unspeakable sadness, for indeed the lad had been the apple of his
eye, and he knew too well his failing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time, father!&rdquo; said the son, with some
effrontery in spite of his perturbation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s damned little left between us: we&rsquo;re
at the dregs of the old Bordeaux.&nbsp; I dropped&mdash;I dropped
something last time I was here, I fancy, and I&rsquo;m come to
seek for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s cheek in the daytime would have ashened: in
the taper light it merely shook and crinkled colourlessly like a
scum.&nbsp; He held the brooch out in his hand, and asked,
&ldquo;Is that it, Stephen?&rdquo; in the simple phrase of a man
with his last illusion shattered, and the son confessed.</p>
<p>He had been shown to the strong-room when he carried the
brooch to Mellish: the sight of its contents and all their
possibilities of life and pleasure had fevered him with desire:
he had returned in cover of <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>night and plundered the treasure of
The Peel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo; cried Wanlock, &ldquo;must I now pay
teind to hell?&nbsp; &lsquo;He that begetteth a fool doeth it to
his own sorrow, and the father of a fool hath no
joy.&rsquo;&nbsp; And where, my rogue, have ye put your
plunder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the worst of it,&rdquo; said Stephen:
&ldquo;you have it all there in your hand!&nbsp; It lay apart
from the rest, and I put it in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A liar, too!&rdquo; wailed Wanlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing but the truth,&rdquo; protested Stephen
sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was observed, whether by man or woman,
beast or bugle, I cannot tell, but I heard the laugh at my elbow,
and I ran.&nbsp; It pattered at my heels, and would have caught
me if I had not dropped my burden in the old Peel
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there let it lie and rot!&rdquo; exclaimed his
father: &ldquo;But you&mdash;oh, Stephen!&mdash;you to be the
robber! and bring on me the <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>second blow!&rdquo; and the
wine-vault rang with the blame and lamentation of a shattered
man.</p>
<p>The son was packed off on the morrow lest a worse thing should
befall in a suspicion of his part in the fall of Mellish: his
father paid the last penny of his available money for the journey
to the south; the search for the spoiler passed into other parts
of the country, and was speedily abandoned.&nbsp; When the hue
and cry had ceased, old Wanlock, professing to have found the
brooch on the roadside, sent it back to Mellish, and waited with
a savage expectation for another demonstration of its power.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait.&nbsp; The very day on which the
talisman was sent, the match of Mellish with the Glasfurd
girl&mdash;as rich as she was proud, haughty, and
ambitious&mdash;was broken off by one who could not bring herself
to marry a beggared man, and the tale, by gossip amplified and <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>rendered
almost laughable, went round the parish like a song.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Dreghorn brought the news to Manor&mdash;the
ancient wooer.&nbsp; Wanlock broke a bottle of wine and made the
occasion festival, but Mirren could not be discovered.</p>
<p>Full of his plans, her father went that evening to her chamber
at an hour when she should be bedded, and found with apprehension
that although the door was barred the chamber held no
tenant.&nbsp; He went outside in darkness lashed by rain, and to
her open window: made his way within&mdash;and found the brooch
upon her unpressed pillow!&nbsp; It caught a flicker from the
fire and shot a lance of light across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Wanlock harshly, &ldquo;oh, my
God! is this himself, Mahoun?&rdquo; and with the jewel burning
in his loof, he turned to see his daughter, with a face of shame
and fear, framed in the open <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>window.&nbsp; She had, in other
hours, a sweetness and a charm like sunny Highland weather, or
like the little lone birds of the sea, or like an air of youth
remembered; but now arising from the outer night of misty
exhalations, pallid against the background of the Manor trees,
she seemed a blameful ghost.</p>
<p>He dragged her to his feet: as she knelt and cowered, he
stamped with brutal passion on her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have ye been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gallant spirit plucked her back from the edge of swound to
which his cruel act had brought her: she looked without a tremor
in his face, and the third blow fell when she told him she had
been to Mellish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mellish!&rdquo; he cried aghast, &ldquo;and, madam,
what in the name of God have you to do with Mellish?&nbsp; He
gave you this?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pressed with a brutal thumb
the fateful gem against her parted lips so sore it seemed to shed
its juices like a berry.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;I love him, and he has long loved me,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! and there was the Glasfurd woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had never loved her, or only thought so at the
first, and the freedom she has given him has more than made
amends for his poverty.&nbsp; Father, I am going to marry
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mellish!&nbsp; A ruined man!&nbsp; And you know my pact
with Dreghorn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pact, father, but never mine: I should die
first.&nbsp; It was the horrid prospect sent me to The Peel
to-night.&nbsp; The thing is settled: he gave me his troth with
the brooch you hold there in your hand&mdash;oh, the dear brooch!
the sweet brooch of happy omen!&mdash;and you will let us marry,
will you not?&nbsp; I would never marry wanting your
consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ye will never have it if the man is
Mellish!&rdquo; cried her father.&nbsp; He thundered threats: he
almost wept entreaties: every <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>scrap of his affection reft from her
and centred now on his blackguard son, but the girl was staunch:
that night he drove her from his door.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was with huge dismay he came upon the gem a fortnight later
on the floor of his girl&rsquo;s deserted chamber.&nbsp; This new
appearance for a moment filled his soul with panic&mdash;it
seemed the very pestilence that walks in darkness&mdash;and then
he realised she must have left it on the night he sent her
forth.&nbsp; With the assassin&rsquo;s heart and the family
humour, that had not been confined to Lady Grace, he wrapped the
jewel up and sent it as his wedding-present to The Peel.</p>
<p>To his outcast daughter and the man who loved her he could
have done no kinder act, for their marriage hung upon his giving
to it something of his countenance, and this ironic gift of what
to them was ever a talisman benign, came to relieve a piteous
situation.&nbsp; <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>Mirren loved, but she had made a promise not to wed
without her father&rsquo;s willingness, and she was such that she
should keep her promise though her life was marred.</p>
<p>With a light heart, then, did Mellish ride with the jewel in
his pocket to the house in town where she had taken refuge, and
gladly taking the gem as proof of her father&rsquo;s softening,
she married the man of her desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, goodwife,&rdquo; said Mellish, &ldquo;I will
go down to Manor and make peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will take our lucky amulet,&rdquo; she said, as she
pinned it in his scarf, and he galloped with the gaiety of a boy
through the fallen autumn leaves to the house of Wanlock.</p>
<p>It was as if he came from realms of morning freshness to some
Terror Isle.&nbsp; Gloaming was come down upon that sad reclusive
lowland country: the silvery fog which often filled the valley
where the mansion lay, austere and old and lonely, gave to the
natural dusk a quality of dream, <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>an air of vague estrangement, a
brooding and expectant sentiment.&nbsp; The trees stood round
like sighing ghosts, and evening birds were mourning in the
clammy thickets.&nbsp; Only one light burned in the impoverished
dwelling; Mellish, through the open window where it beamed
uncurtained, saw old Wanlock sunk in meditation with a Bible on
his knees, and with a heart of pity left the saddle.</p>
<p>Oh God! that men should die within stark walls in ancient
long-descended properties, without a comprehension of the meaning
of the misty world!</p>
<p>He passed within the frowning arch and beat upon the
knocker.&nbsp; The clangour rang through the dark interior: the
night stood hushed, save for the inquiry of the howlets in the
pines, the plunge of the Manor Burn, the drip of crisply falling
perished leaves, and, far away upon the coast, the roaring of the
sea.&nbsp; Pervaded by the spirit of the scene and hour,
misgivings came to Mellish, <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>in whose heart the night seemed all
at once inimical, fantastic, peopled with incorporeal
presences.&nbsp; He heard their mutter, heard them move with
cunning footsteps; of a sudden, near at hand broke forth the
dolorous utterance of a soul beseeching and forlorn.&nbsp; The
dreary note, prolonged and dying slowly, seemed to roll in waves
far out on shoreless seas of space, and Mellish, agitated, beat
again upon the ponderous brass.</p>
<p>He heard the halting shuffle of feet within; the door was
opened; Wanlock stood with a candle in the entrance.&nbsp; One
glance only he gave to Mellish, and slammed the door in his
face!</p>
<p>Abruptly from the crowding night round Mellish burst a peal of
mad and mocking laughter!</p>
<p>For a moment fear, resentment, and disbelief warred in his
brain for his possession: fear, being stranger there, was routed
by an effort of the will; disbelief surrendered to his reason; he
was left alone on the battlefield <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>with anger.&nbsp; It swept with
purple banners through the rally of his senses: drunk with
passion, he tore from his breast the gem that had misled him to
that hateful door, and flung it in by the open window, then
leaped upon his horse and galloped furiously for home.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Wanlock, with the candle in his hand, stood for a moment
listening in the passage, glad with venom.&nbsp; He heard the
thud of hoofs die off in the distance of the avenue, then, with a
shock that left him trembling, the ululation of his old
familiar&mdash;that dreadful bittern call!&nbsp; It was to-night
more sad than he had ever heard it, more imbued with hopeless
longing, yet in some way through its desolation went a yapping
note of menace and alarm.</p>
<p>He hurried to his chamber with a sense of something older than
mankind: he set the candle on the table; turned with eagerness to
lift the Book&mdash;the comforter, the <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>shield,&mdash;and there between the open pages, on the
final verses of the seventh Psalm, lay the accursed brooch!</p>
<p>It seemed to him like a thing that had come from the void
outside the rim of human life where evils muster with black wings
and the torments of men are fashioned.&nbsp; He whimpered as he
made to seize it, then, as if it stung him, felt a numbness in
the arm.&nbsp; Through his brain for a moment went the feeling of
something gush: he staggered on the floor: a mist swept through
his eyes.&nbsp; His vision cleared, and he saw the jewel at his
feet.&nbsp; He bent to lift it with some curious failure in his
members, groped with an impercipient hand, and found his fingers
would not close upon it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;what is this come on
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; A mocking chuckle sounded through the room, and
the final doubts of Wanlock vanished&mdash;another blow was come,
and he was in the grip of the Adversary!</p>
<p>With his other hand he caught the gem, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>and rising
slowly, cast a glance of wild expectancy about the room.&nbsp; No
assurance came from the discovery that to the eye at least he was
alone, yet a subtler sense than vision told him he had company,
and he looked above him into the umber rafters, then turning to
the window, saw enormous hands claw on the sill.&nbsp; They
seemed to drag a weight from the nether world behind them: he
watched them fascinated, even to the sinews&rsquo; tension, till
there raised and rested on the backs of them a face more horrible
than he had ever dreamt of&mdash;blurred, maculate,
amorphous!&nbsp; From the sallow visage peered inquiring eyes
profound with cunning, and the soul of Wanlock grewed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wrestle,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
the rulers of the darkness&rdquo;: he seized upon the Book, and
held it up before him like a buckler, all his being drenched in
the spirit of defiance, and he cried the Holy Name.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>He
cried it as they cried it on the moors&mdash;his people, when the
troopers rode upon them: he cried with their conviction that the
Blood had all things pacified, redeemed, and the apparition
chuckled!</p>
<p>The last redoubt of Wanlock&rsquo;s faith surrendered: he
madly wrenched a page from the sacred volume, crushed it with the
jewel in his hand, and threw them in the face of his tormentor,
then fell, a withered man, upon the bedstead, while the bittern
cry outside arose in demon laughter.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When he drifted back from the bliss of his oblivion, he lay a
while like a child that makes its world afresh each morning from
a few familiar surrounding things&mdash;the light, the shade, the
feel of textures, and the sound of the cinder falling on the
hearthstone.&nbsp; All his life came ranked before him in epochs
that grew more vivid as his brain grew clear&mdash;the folly of
youth, the vanity of manhood, the pride of his strength, the <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>dour
determination of his will; but he saw them all as virtues.&nbsp;
Had he not prayed, and sat at the Communion?&nbsp; Had he not
felt the gust of the Holy Spirit?&nbsp; Had he not
repented?&mdash;nay, penitence had been denied him from his very
birth, and without repentance well he knew there was no
sin&rsquo;s remission.&nbsp; Thus are the unelect at last
condemned for a natural inability&mdash;terror they have and
chagrin at results, but no regret for the essential wrong.&nbsp;
There was a sound of some one moving in the house&mdash;the
servant, who had been on a private escapade of her own, was now
returned.&nbsp; Wanlock seized a walking-cane he kept beside the
bedstead for the purpose, and he loudly rapped upon the
wall.&nbsp; At first there was no answer; then he rapped again,
and the woman entered, flushed with some spirit of adventure.</p>
<p>She had the radiant sleekness of the country&rsquo;s
girls,&mdash;a strapping, rosy healthfulness, a jaunty carriage,
and a dancing and <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>inviting eye: she seemed to Wanlock for a moment like a
stranger, and she carried with her scents of the cool night
winds.</p>
<p>For a moment she looked at him, astounded&mdash;he had so
suddenly grown very old and his mouth so strangely twisted; then
she gave a little cry, and hurried to his bedside, and he saw
that the shawl she wore was pinned upon her shoulder by the
luckless brooch!</p>
<p>It glowed portentous and commanding like a meteor; with the
squeal of a netted hare he grasped at his walking-cane, and
struck with fury at the object of his terror.&nbsp; The woman
shrank before the blow; the rattan swept the candle from the
table to the floor: a fountain of flame from the hell that is
under life sprang up the bedstead curtains!</p>
<p>With an oath old Wanlock staggered from his bed in time to
save himself, but the Manor-house was doomed&mdash;at dawn the
bitter smell of woody ashes blew across the valley.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>From
the shabby lodge-house midway in the avenue he looked astonished
at the girdling hills, to see them all so steadfast and
indifferent: the sun came up and sailed across the heavens,
heedless of the smouldering space among the pines, where turret
and tower more lofty than themselves had seemed, a day ago,
eternal.&nbsp; The rat squeaked as it burrowed for a new home
under fallen lintels; the raven croaked upon the cooling
hearth.&nbsp; And night came down on these charred relics,
swiftly&mdash;night, the old conquering rider, ally of
despair!&nbsp; It appeared to Wanlock like a thousand years since
he had had a careless heart, yet the ruin of his home for the
moment seemed less dreadful than its cause, and the new light it
had thrown on his situation.&nbsp; Never before was he so
desolate, so desolate!&mdash;forsaken of God and man.&nbsp; All
night his flaming house had stained the clouds: the crackle of
its timbers and the thunder of its falling walls appeared to fill
the whole world&rsquo;s ear, yet <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>none had come to his assistance: as
if abhorred by all, he was left to dree his weird alone among the
ashes.</p>
<p>One thing only he had saved besides his life&mdash;a bottle of
Bordeaux.&nbsp; He had seized upon it as the only friend from
whom he could look for consolation.&nbsp; Even the maid and the
dog had fled from him, but she returned at nightfall to the
cheerless lodge to make it habitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the name of God got ye yon accursed
thing?&rdquo; he asked her, and she told him, flushing, she had
got it from a lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lover!&rdquo; quo&rsquo; Wanlock, regarding his
helpless arm, remembering happier things.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are there
still folk loving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what he would like to be,&rdquo; said the
woman awkwardly; &ldquo;but the man&rsquo;s a dwarfish waif I
daren&rsquo;t hardly venture through the woods for; ye&rsquo;ll
have heard him screech for a month past.&nbsp; He haunts me like
a bogle, comes from I kenna where&mdash;a crazy, crooked, gangrel
body, worse than <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>the Blednock brownie.&nbsp; He was squatted at the door
last night when I got home, and he gave me the
brooch,&mdash;I&mdash;I wish to the Lord I had never seen
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it now?&rdquo; asked Wanlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have given it back,&rdquo; the girl replied
with some confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye were wise in that,&rdquo; said her master.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Woe upon the owner of the havock brooch! for I have had it
too, and the heart of me is withered in my bosom.&nbsp; No
brooch, no human brooch, I&rsquo;ll warrant! but a clot of the
blood that dried on the spear of the Roman soldier.&nbsp; Ye have
trafficked with the devil and have worn his seal.&nbsp; It has
robbed me of my money and my home, my son, my daughter, and the
power of my members&mdash;look at that blemished arm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched him for a moment, fascinated, seeing now his
palsy; he beheld the pity in her eye, resenting it, and caught
with his able hand at the bottle of Bordeaux which he poured with
a splash into a <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>tarnished goblet.&nbsp; He was about to drink it when
he saw a look of fear and speculation come upon her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the Lord forgive me, Manor!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;but I gave the brooch this morning to your son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my son!&rdquo; he cried, incredulous.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How could you have seen him?&nbsp; He is far from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never left the country,&rdquo; cried the woman,
weeping, &ldquo;and I have known his hiding all the time.&nbsp;
He saw the brooch upon me, was furious when he heard how I had
got it, and made me give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furious,&rdquo; said Wanlock curiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Had he the right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None better,&rdquo; said the woman, looking on the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have guessed,&rdquo; said Wanlock
bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Though thou shouldst bray a fool in
a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness
depart from him.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has the brooch!&nbsp; Then are
his footsteps <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>dogged by the Accuser of the Brethren, for the gem is
hell&rsquo;s bell-wether!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was tranquil, windless, frosty-cold; deep in the
valley&rsquo;s labyrinth lay the lodge-house, far from other
dwellings, alien, apparently forgot, with the black plumes of the
trees above it.&nbsp; In pauses of the conversation something
troubled Wanlock like the fear of ambush; some absorbing sense of
breathing shadows: silence itself took on a substance and stood
listening at the threshold.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a scratching at the door, and Wanlock
blenched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God save us!&rdquo; said the girl, and her face like
sleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare ye to open the door!&rdquo; cried Wanlock,
shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the dog,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;the dog
come back; I left it in the company of Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some compact here with things beyond
me,&rdquo; said her master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open&mdash;open the door
and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>One
glance only Wanlock gave at the grey dog trotting in, and fell to
weeping when he saw a neckcloth pinned upon it with the
brooch!&nbsp; He reeled a moment at the sight, then fumbled at
the neckcloth and drew out the gem.&nbsp; With a curse he cast it
in the heart of the burning peats, where it lay a little,
blinking rubescent, then rolled among the cooler ashes.&nbsp; He
moved expectant to the open door where the dog was leading: the
girl took up the gem, which stung her like an asp upon the palm;
she dropped it in the goblet where it hissed and cooled among the
wine, and at that moment rose the cry of Stephen in the
avenue.</p>
<p>With a snatch at the burning candles she ran out behind her
master where he stood with head uplifted looking at the squadrons
of the stars.&nbsp; She was the first to reach the figure lying
on the ground, and putting down the candlesticks, she raised the
lad, whose face was agonised and white like <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>sapple of
the sea.&nbsp; He had no eyes for them, but, trembling, searched
with a fearful glance the cavern of the night made little by the
candles burning in the breathless avenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stephen! Stephen! what has happened?&rdquo; cried the
girl, her lips upon his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it caught me,&rdquo; gasped the lad.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I ran from The Peel, and it caught me, clawed upon my
thrapple, and left me here.&nbsp; I pinned my neckcloth on the
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned upon the woman, helpless in his terror.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bring me the wine!&rdquo; she bade her master, and old
Wanlock stumbled back to fetch it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Stephen! Stephen! what were ye doing at The
Peel?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye know ye promised
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not help myself,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;knowing what was in the well.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas that that
kept me in the country.&nbsp; I got it out and was making off
with it when I <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>heard the eerie laugh again.&nbsp; I dropped the
plunder at the very door of Mellish when the de&rsquo;il was on
me.&nbsp; He was no bigger than a bairn, but he kept upon my
heels till I got here, and then he leaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Stephen! oh, my Stephen!&rdquo; cried the woman,
fondling him upon her breast, and he hung within her arms.&nbsp;
A snarl came from the shadows: a creature smelling of mould and
rotten leafage, clothed as in ragged lichens, contorted like a
pollard willow, leaped at the throat of Stephen and crushed it
like a paste, then fled with the bittern call.</p>
<p>Old Wanlock heard the woman shriek: he tottered with the
goblet from the lodge and came within the circuit of the candles
where she knelt beside her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone! he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; she cried,
demented.&nbsp; &ldquo;The devil has strangled him,&rdquo; and at
the moment passed the ghost of Stephen Wanlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said the father&mdash;&ldquo;very
well <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>I
knew it: the sixth blow!&nbsp; There is no discharge in this
war!&rdquo;&nbsp; His head seemed filled with wool: his blood
went curdling in its channels, and he staggered on his
feet.&nbsp; Raising the goblet till it chattered on his teeth, he
drained it at a draught, and the woman, heedless, straightened
out the body of his son.</p>
<p>She heard her master choke: she turned to see his face
convulsed, his eyeballs staring, and the empty flagon falling
from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brooch! the brooch!&rdquo; she screamed: a gleam of
comprehension passed for a moment over Wanlock&rsquo;s purpling
visage: he raised his arms, and stumbling, fell across the body
of his son!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> husband, with an eye of warm
alacrity and a welcome manner that should have made his fortune
in some livelier hostel than the dreary inn of Flanders Moss,
regarded the stranger with compassion.&nbsp; The wife, an acrid
peevish body, ill-content to be roused from bed at such an hour,
plucked at the strings of her night-cap, loosened and fastened
them half a dozen times as if they bridled a wroth that choked
her, and looked with candid disapproval on the customer standing
in the kitchen with the rain running from his wrap-rascal coat on
the fresh-caumed flagstones of her floor.</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; she coughed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
no&rsquo; a time o&rsquo; the year when we&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo;
for many visitors to the Flanders Moss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still-and-on ye&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; said the
husband hastily, tender of the stranger&rsquo;s feelings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s an egg or twa, Jennet, isna
there?&nbsp; And&mdash;and the hen; or&mdash;or yon
ham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jennet tied her cap more tightly down upon her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was making for the port o&rsquo; Menteith,&rdquo;
explained the stranger in a breath, compassing the chamber and
the characters before him at a gled&rsquo;s glance, feeling
himself master of them both, flinging off the wrap-rascal and
throwing his bonnet on the hearth to dry.&nbsp; It struck the
stone with a sodden slap that would have made plain the kind of
night from which he had escaped, even if the ear had not more
eloquently indicated that the house was in the very throat of
tempest.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no hae pack nor powney?&rdquo; said
the dame sourly, with a pursed mouth, surveying the young
man&rsquo;s hose, the clinging knee-breeches, the stained red
waistcoat, and the shabby green cutaway coat, but more intent
upon the dissipation of his shaven boyish countenance, the
disorder of his hair, and his reckless eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a nicht for a
cadger&rsquo;s dog, let alane a powney,&rdquo; said the amiable
host; and then, in a beseeching tone that told the nature of
their partnery, &ldquo;Am I richt or am I wrang, Jennet?&nbsp; At
least there maun be an egg or twa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife scowled at her mate, and said emphatically that eggs
were out of the question, and the hour was quite ridiculous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no heedin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the stranger;
&ldquo;I had a meal of a kind at Fintry.&nbsp; What I
want&rsquo;s a bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll get that!&rdquo; cried the landlord
heartily, glad to be assured of a speedy <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>return to
his own blankets.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a snug bed ben, and
ye&rsquo;ll hae a&rsquo; the better appetite for
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s your security?&rdquo; demanded madam,
and the goodman sighed.</p>
<p>Her customer shrugged his shoulders, threw himself in a chair,
and thrust his feet out to the fire of turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said God was my security,&rdquo; remarked the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye couldna hae better!&rdquo; cried the innkeeper, and
drawing a chopin of ale for the pious gentleman, beat down by the
very gust of his geniality the rising opposition of the
woman&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later Black Andy went to bed in the ben.&nbsp;
He went with his boots on, for he had, in the very act of
stooping to unlace them by the light of a tallow candle, seen
that which led at the end to the rout of any thought of
sleep.&nbsp; The <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>candle, which he had placed on the floor the better to
see his knots untied, threw a beam under a heavy oaken kist in
the corner, and glinted on a ring of brass that oddly hung from
the bottom of the box.&nbsp; He threw up the lid, to find no more
than a pile of homespun blanketing; then turned the kist quietly
on its side, to learn that the ring was on the latch of a secret
bottom.&nbsp; He opened it: the shallow space between the false
bottom and the real one seemed at first to hold no more than
rags; but fumbling through them, he found a leather pouch with
three-and-twenty guineas&mdash;madam&rsquo;s private hoard!&nbsp;
As he counted the money silently on the covering of the bed, the
storm that held the Flanders Moss in its possession seemed for
the while to hold its breath, as he did his own, so that he could
hear the thud of his heart and each reluctant tick of the kitchen
clock.</p>
<p>For an hour he lay in darkness, wide awake, with the pouch in
his breast.&nbsp; The <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>murmur of voices in the kitchen
ceased, its light went out; the lonely inn on the edge of the
moor was black, and wholly lost in the privacy of the night.</p>
<p>The innkeeper, easy man! turned his face to the box-bed wall
in the kitchen, and counted sheep going through a dip-tank till
the fleece of the last of them spread, and spread, and spread,
like a magic counterpane, and fell on him at last, smothering him
to sleep.&nbsp; It was his goodwife&rsquo;s elbow.&nbsp; For she
lay on her back, her hands hollowed behind her ears, her
cap-strings loose, and listened for some other sound than the
creak of the roof-cabars, the whistle of the thatch, and
tempest&rsquo;s all-pervading symphony.&nbsp; Ah! it would have
been an easier night for her if she had had some chance to put
her money elsewhere; it was her evil star that had surely brought
this man to Flanders Moss on a Hogmanay, the very night when all
honest bodies ought to be at their own fire-ends!</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>A
sound in the room where he lay brought her sitting up in bed with
every sense alert.&nbsp; A sash squeaked: she shook her husband
out of the fleece of sleep, and they jumped together to the
chamber door.&nbsp; It opened to a gale that blew right through
it from an open window: their lodger was gone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kent it!&rdquo; cried the woman furiously, and
shrieked to realise, by a feel of the hand in the dark, that her
hoard had been discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dod, now, that&rsquo;s droll!&rdquo; said her husband,
scratching his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;And him had such good
security!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>II.</h3>
<p>Black Andy, with the pouch of guineas comforting the breast of
him like liquor, so that he hardly missed his wrap-rascal or his
bonnet that were drying by the kitchen fire, ran along the broken
road for Kippen.&nbsp; It was like the bed of a burn, and like a
rested monster rose the storm afresh from the Hieland
hills.&nbsp; One glance he gave behind him at a step or two from
the window whence he burst; so dark was the night that the inn in
the womb of it was quite invisible.&nbsp; He looked over his
shoulder for a second time, having run for a little, and saw the
bobbing of a lanthorn.&nbsp; His amiable host was already on his
track, and Kippen was plainly no place for Black Andy.</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>With
an oath he quitted the road, ran down through a clump of hazel,
and launched on the rushy moss that (as the story goes) had once
been a part of the sea that threshed on Stirling rock.</p>
<p>Like many another man, this scamp, unskilled in thievery, had
no sooner escaped the urgent danger of arrest than he rued his
impulsive fall to the temptation of a bag of clinking
coins.&nbsp; He had drunk through an idle youth, and others had
paid the lawing; he had diced and cheated; he had borrowed and
left unpaid; he had sold bad cattle and denied his warrandice; he
had lived without labour&mdash;all of which is no more different
from theft than tipsyness is different from drunkenness.&nbsp;
But hitherto he had stopped on the verge of crime denominate, and
it was his mother&rsquo;s only glad reflection when the thought
of his follies haunted her pillow.&nbsp; Had the temptation of
the inn-wife&rsquo;s gold come to him on another night, and
elsewhere, he could have <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>turned the broad of his back on it,
and mustered conquering hosts of fear and of expedience to his
support; the misfortune was that it found him in a desperate
hour.&nbsp; For a week he had been in a most jovial company with
some Campsie lairds; he had spent the price of his father&rsquo;s
horse to the last plack royally, as if he had been a bonnet-laird
himself, and New Year&rsquo;s Day should have seen him back at
Blaruisken with the price of the horse, or else it meant
disaster.&nbsp; Even that consideration scarcely would have made
a thief of him (as he thought now), but for the wife in the Moss
of Flanders inn; she had so little deserved to be the sole
possessor of such gold.&nbsp; A comely wife, a civil wife, a
reasonably hospitable wife (as he argued with himself), might
have kept her money on the doorstep, and he would have been the
last to meddle with it; but this one deserved some punishment,
and he was, in a fashion, Heaven&rsquo;s instrument.&nbsp; <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>The
husband&mdash;true, he was a kindly soul (and here the instrument
of Heaven found his sophistry weak a little at the knees); but
Black Andy had an intuition that the hoard was secret, even from
the husband, and he guessed aright the wife would never report
the actual nature of her loss.</p>
<p>He seemed the more contemptible a thief to himself, because in
one particular he had blundered like a fool.&nbsp; For yonder,
beiking before the innkeeper&rsquo;s fire, were his wrap-rascal
and his bonnet&mdash;the first, at least, a clue to his
identity.&nbsp; There was not another wrap-rascal than his own in
his native parish; the very name of the coat had seemed too
sinister for his mother, and the garment made him kenspeckle over
half the shire.&nbsp; Though the folk in the inn of the Flanders
Moss might never before have cast an eye on him, they had but to
hang that garment on a whin-bush at their door to learn his
history from scores of passers-by.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>Thinking thus&mdash;not any penitent in him, but the
poltroon that is in all of us at the thought of discovery by the
world of what we really are&mdash;the woman&rsquo;s money coldly
weighed upon his bosom like a divot.&nbsp; By God! a rotten
bargain had he made&mdash;to swap the easy mind of innocence for
three days&rsquo; drinking with numskull bonnet-lairds in a
Campsie tavern.</p>
<p>But the thing was done, with no remedy; there was nothing for
it but to tramp home and meet his obligation to his father.</p>
<p>So busily did his mind engage with these considerations that
the increase of the tempest for a little never touched his
comprehension.&nbsp; He came to himself with a start at a stumble
in a hag whose water almost reached his knees, and realised that
he was ignorant of the airt he moved to, and that the passion of
the night was like to shake the world in tatters.&nbsp; The very
moss below him seemed to quiver like a bog; no rush, no heather
shrub, but had its <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>shrieking share in the cacophony of that unco hour upon
the curdled spaces of the ancient sea.&nbsp; Black Andy put out
his cold-starved hand before his face, and peered for it in vain;
it might have been a hand of ebony.</p>
<p>For hours he laboured through that windy desert, airting, as
he judged by the wind, for the north, as far away as possible
from the inn of his misdoing, and weariness seemed to turn his
blood to spring-well water, and his flesh to wool, so that the
earthy cushion of the hags in which he sometimes stumbled tempted
him to lie and sleep.&nbsp; The last sheuch would have done his
business if he had not, sitting on its edge, beheld a glimmer of
light from a window.&nbsp; He dragged with an effort towards it,
climbed a dry-stone dyke, and felt with his hands along the back
of some dwelling which he took for a shepherd&rsquo;s hut, until
he came upon the door.&nbsp; Breathlessly he leaned his shoulder
to it and loudly rapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First-foot!&rdquo; he heard a voice exclaim, <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>and
remembered it was the New Year&rsquo;s Day as the bolt shot back
and he fell in the arms&mdash;of the innkeeper!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re back, my man!&rdquo; cried the
innkeeper&rsquo;s wife, with a face as white as sleet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be to pay your lodging?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut! never mind the lawin&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the New Year&rsquo;s Day, and here&rsquo;s your dram,&rdquo; said
the genial landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, man, yon was a bonny prank
to play on us!&nbsp; We thought ye were awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the
wife&rsquo;s best blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a lodgin&rsquo;s aye a lodgin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
the wife nervously; and Andy laughed, knowing her
perturbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the lawin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he exclaimed, and
banged her pouch of guineas in her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll
can count it later, and I&rsquo;m awa&rsquo; to my bed
again.&nbsp; Were ye really feared I was gaein&rsquo; to cheat
ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the innkeeper who answered; his wife was off with her
hoardings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I kent ye had
Grand Security.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MacDonnell</span> of Morar, on the summer
of his marriage, and when the gladness of it was still in every
vein, sailed his sloop among the Isles.&nbsp; He went from sound
to sound, from loch to loch, anchoring wherever the fancy took
his lady, and the two of them were seeking what no one ever found
nor shall find&mdash;that last and swooning pang of pleasure the
Isles in summer weather, either at dawn or dusk, seem always to
promise to youth and love.&nbsp; At night they lay in bays in the
dim light of the cool north stars, or in the flush of the <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>sunken sun
that made wine of the sea-waves, and the island cliffs or the
sandy shores seemed populous with birds or singing
fisher-people.</p>
<p>It was very well then with Morar.</p>
<p>His wife was still a girl.&nbsp; In the mornings, when she
came on deck with her hair streaming and the breeze making a
banner of her gown, her gaiety surging to her breast in song, she
seemed to him and to his men like one of the olden sea princesses
told about in Gaelic stories, born from foam for the happiness
and hurt of the hearts of men.&nbsp; She was lovely, tender, and
good, and he himself, with those that knew him best, was notable
for every manly part.&nbsp; One thing only he had a fear of in
his bride&mdash;that, as had happened with others before, and
perhaps with himself, a day might come to him when the riddle of
her would be read, her maidenly sweet mystery revealed; when he
could guess with certainty what was in the deep dark wells of her
eyes, and <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>understand, without a word, the cause for every throb
of her bosom.&nbsp; To have her for ever with a part to baffle
and allure, as does the sea in its outer caves, and as do the
dawns in Highland glens&mdash;that was the wish of Morar.</p>
<p>The captain of the yacht, who, having no passion for her, knew
her, some ways, better than her husband, perhaps, said she had
what, westward in the Barra Isle he hailed from, they call the
Seven Gifts for Women&mdash;content and gentleness, looks and
liking, truth, simplicity, and the fear of God.&nbsp; To him and
to his men&mdash;gallant fellows from Skye, and somewhat jealous
of her that she was not of the isles herself, but a
stranger&mdash;she was at least without a flaw.&nbsp; One time
they thought it might be temper was her weakness, for she walked
the deck with pride and had a noble carriage of the head, but the
tiniest cloud of temper never crossed her honeymoon.&nbsp;
Indeed, it was well with Morar.</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>And
it seemed that summer as if the very clime befriended him, for
there never blew but the finest breezes, and the sun was almost
constant in the sky.&nbsp; Round all the remoter isles they
sailed&mdash;even Harris and the Uists, and the countless lesser
isles that lie to the west of Scotland,&mdash;an archipelago
where still are dwelling the ancient Gaelic gods, whereto at
least they come at sunset and sit upon the sands communing, so
that sailors knowing the language, and having the happy ear, can
sometimes catch far off at sea deep murmurs of the olden world
that others take for the plash of waters.</p>
<p>Morar&rsquo;s wife put the yacht into every creek.&nbsp; She
loved the little creeks, she doted on the burns going mourning
through the darkness, and on the sound of tides on shallow
shores; it was her great delight sometimes to sleep on land below
a canvas shelter, bathe at morning in the inner pools, walk
barefooted on the sand, or stand on <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>rocky promontories facing the rising
sun, with her hair tumultuous.&nbsp; Her first breakfast then was
the wild berry, her morning drink the water from island
wells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could live on the berries,&rdquo; she would say to
her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I love them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless, mochree,&rdquo; would he answer her,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Faith! it&rsquo;s my notion they have been
growing all these years in the islands waiting just for you;
their bloom is on your cheek; it&rsquo;s the berry stain that was
on your lips since ever I knew you.&nbsp; But for a common person
like myself there is a certain seduction in a sea-trout or a
herring.&nbsp; Madam, I wish you joy of your wild berries, and
indeed I love the taste of them&mdash;on your lips,&mdash;but let
me press on you a simple cabin-biscuit, though it suffers from
having been baked by the hand of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the berry comes straight from God,&rdquo; would be
her answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fruiting of the clean
wild wind; I <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>sometimes think that if I could eat it always I should
live for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, faith, I&rsquo;ll grow it in Morar garden by the
pole, and you shall eat berries at every meal,&rdquo; said her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll acquire the taste
myself.&nbsp; Meanwhile, let me recommend the plain prose of our
cooking galley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I declare that I can find in pure water something
as intoxicating as wine and far more subtle on the
palate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A noble beverage, at least they tell me so, as the
piper says in the story,&rdquo; said Morar, &ldquo;yet God forbid
that a too exclusive diet of berries and water should send
Macdonnell back a widower to Morar!&nbsp; I take leave to help
you to another egg,&rdquo; and so saying he would laugh at her
again, and she would laugh also, for the truth was that she never
brought to the cabin table but a yachtsman&rsquo;s appetite.</p>
<p>One thing she missed in all these island voyagings was the
green companionship of <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>trees.&nbsp; She came from a land of
trees, and sailing day after day past isles that gave no harbour
to so little as a sapling, she fretted sometimes for the shady
deeps of thicket and the sway of boughs.&nbsp; Often she sat on
deck at nightfall and imagined what the isles must have been
before disaster overtook them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you think of us wandering in the avenues, sitting
in the glades?&nbsp; Barefoot or sandal, loose light garments,
berries and water, the bland sea air, shade from the sun and
shelter from the shower, and the two of us always young and
always the same to each other&rdquo;&mdash;it was a picture she
put before him many times, half entranced, as if she once had
known a life like that before far back in another age and climate
than in Scotland of the storms.&nbsp; Kissing her lips, wet from
some mountain well, her husband got to look on her now and then
as some Greek girl of the books, and himself as an eternal lover
who had <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>heard the wind blowing through boughs in Arcady.</p>
<p>Loving trees as she did, it was strange that so long they
should have failed to visit Island Faoineas, for often in their
voyagings it lay before them on the sea&mdash;green, gracious,
and inviting, its single hill luxuriant with hazel-grown
<i>eas</i> or corrie, its little glen adorned with old
plantations.&nbsp; It lies behind Bernera, south of Harris,
hiding coy among other isles and out of the track of vessels, and
for reasons of his own the captain of the yacht sailed always at
a distance from it, keeping it in the sun&rsquo;s eye so that its
trees should seem like black tall cliffs with the white waves
churning at their feet.&nbsp; But one day Morar and his wife came
to him with the chart.&nbsp; &ldquo;This island here,&rdquo; they
said together.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have not seen it close at hand;
let us go there to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s face changed; he made many excuses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A shabby, small place,&rdquo; <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>he told them, &ldquo;with a poor
anchorage.&nbsp; And the wind is going westward with the
sun.&nbsp; I think myself Lochmaddy better for an anchoring this
night than Ealan Faoineas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the name mean&mdash;this Ealan
Faoineas?&rdquo; asked Morar&rsquo;s wife, looking out toward the
island that was too distant yet to show its trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said Morar, &ldquo;the Isle of
Seeming&mdash;that is to say, the Isle of Illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dear name!&rdquo; she cried, clapping her
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should love to see it.&nbsp; Are there
trees?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eyes were on the captain&rsquo;s face: he
dared not lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you might be calling a sort of trees,&rdquo; he
grudgingly admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, I will not be saying
but what there are two or three trees, or maybe more, for I have
not paid much attention to Ealan Faoineas myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then it is time
you were amending your knowledge of it.&nbsp; <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>I think we
will risk the anchorage for the sake of the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was her own hand put down the helm and herself who called
the men to the sheets, for the captain had a sudden slackness in
his office and was forward murmuring with his crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails him?&rdquo; the lady asked her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have me there!&rdquo; he answered her, as puzzled
as herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it is likely there may be some
superstition about the island; the name suggests as much, and now
that I come to think of it, I remember I once heard as a boy that
sailors never cared to land on one or two of the Outer Isles,
believing them the domain of witchcraft.&nbsp; We must have
passed that island frequently and the captain always kept us wide
of it.&nbsp; I will ask him what its story is that makes him
frightened for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went forward by-and-by and talked with the captain.</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>&ldquo;I am a plain man; I have not the education
except for boats,&rdquo; said the seaman, &ldquo;and I would not
set foot on Faoineas for the wide world.&nbsp; You will not get a
man in all the Outer Islands, from Barra Head to the Butt of
Lewis, who would step on Faoineas if the deck of his skiff was
coming asunder in staves below the very feet of him.&nbsp; I am
brave myself&mdash;oh yes!&nbsp; I come of people exceeding brave
and notable for deeds, but there is not that much gold in all the
Hebrides, no, nor in the realm of Scotland, would buy my landing
in that place yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! come! what is wrong with the island that you
should have such a fear of it?&rdquo; asked Morar, astounded at
so strong a feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bad for men, and it is worse for women,&rdquo;
said the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it something to hurt the body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was but the body I would be the first
ashore!&nbsp; I have not so much money put <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>past me
that I have any need to be afraid for my life,&rdquo; said the
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there ghosts there, then?&rdquo; said Morar,
determined to be at the root of the mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts!&rdquo; cried the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
are they not, these gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the sloop that Morar&rsquo;s wife was steering
had drawn closer on the island, breaking her way among the
billows striving into Harris Sound; and to the gaze of
Morar&rsquo;s wife, and to her great bewilderment, she saw the
little glen with its bushes climbing high on either side of it,
and the tall, great, dark old Highland trees beyond, and thickets
like gardens to the south, and under all the deep cool dusk of
shadows she had longed for all those days that she and her
husband had sought for the last pang of pleasure in their
honeymoon among the Outer Isles.&nbsp; She leaned upon the tiller
and stared entranced and unbelieving, for it seemed a fairy isle,
such as grows fast in dreams and sinks to the sea-depths again <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>when dawn
is on the window.&nbsp; Only when she saw rooks rise with cawings
from the branches, and heard the song of birds unknown on the
treeless islands, was she altogether convinced of its
reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she cried to her husband,
&ldquo;look!&nbsp; Were we not right?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a
forgotten paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If paradise it be, then may you have your share of
it,&rdquo; said the captain as he put them ashore.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Myself, I would not risk it so long as this world has so
many pleasant things to be going on with.&nbsp; All I can tell
you of Island Faoineas is that, paradise or purgatory, it depends
on what one eats and drinks there.&nbsp; I heard it from a priest
in Eriskay, a noble and namely man through all the islands of the
West.&nbsp; Once he had landed here and known some wonders.&nbsp;
He died in Arisaig, and in his dying blessed with the seven
blessings one well upon this island, but which of all that run
there I never learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>That
night Morar and his bride slept out in the shelter of
hazel-bushes and shelisters.&nbsp; They built a fire and drank
out of the same glass from a burn that sang through the
shelisters, and as they slept there were many wells that ran
merrily through their dreams, but one particularly that rose from
a hillock beside them, and tinkled more sweetly than golden
jewels streaming down a golden stair.</p>
<h3><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>II.</h3>
<p>She was the first to waken in the morning, and stealing softly
from him, she left the embers of their fire among the rushes and
went wandering among the trees, so that when he rose he saw her
figure, airy and white, among their columns.&nbsp; She seemed the
spirit of the trees to his doting eye, as though &rsquo;twas
there among them she had always dwelt; the wood was furnished and
completed by her presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not in the world a sweeter place,&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;and I have never seen such berries!&nbsp; Look, I
have brought you some, Sir Sluggard, that we might taste them
first together.&rdquo;&nbsp; She put a spray of the berries
between her teeth and let him <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>sweeten the fruit with a kiss as he
took his share from her lips with his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman tempted me, and I did eat,&rdquo; said Morar,
laughing, and culled the berries with his arms around her.&nbsp;
They burst on his palate with a savour sharp and heady.&nbsp; He
was about to ask for more when he saw her change.&nbsp; The smile
had suddenly gone from her face at his words; for the first time
he saw that her eyes were capable of anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said she in an impatient voice,
&ldquo;I think it a poor compliment to me after my trouble in
getting the berries for you that you should have such a thought
in your head about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; he answered quickly, an
unreasonable vexation sweeping through him in a gust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did ever any one hear the like, that because I am
indifferent to your silly berries you should snarl like a
cat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cat!&rdquo; she cried, furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a cat,&rdquo; he repeated deliberately.&nbsp; <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>&ldquo;For
God&rsquo;s sake give me peace, and get your hair up before the
men come ashore for us.&nbsp; It is time we were home; I am
heart-sick of this sailing.&nbsp; And it ill becomes a woman of
your years to play-act the child and run barefoot about island
sands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The berries she still held in her hand she crushed between her
palms till the juice of them stained her gown and ran like blood
between her fingers.&nbsp; The perfume rose to her nostrils and
seemed to fill her head with a pungent vapour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&nbsp; Well?&rdquo; he said with irritation at her
staring.&nbsp; She covered her eyes with her hands and burst into
tears.</p>
<p>He only whistled.&nbsp; Someway she appeared a sloven in
dress, awkward in gesture, and a figure of insincerity.&nbsp; If
he had not a sudden new conviction that she was everything she
should not be, there was the accent of her voice, the evidence of
his eyesight.&nbsp; For when, in wild exasperation at his manner,
she took her hands from her <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>face, she showed a visage stained
and sour, tempestuous eyes, and lips grown thin and pallid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate you!&nbsp; I hate you!&rdquo; she cried, and
stamped with her bare feet on the sand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot for
my life understand what I ever saw in you that I should have
married you.&nbsp; Any one with her senses might have hesitated
to tie herself for life to a man with so much evil in his
countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours would be none the worse for washing,&rdquo; said
Morar remorselessly, with an eye on her berry-stained face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gentleman!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, my grief, that I should have spoiled my
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew what I was when you took me,&rdquo; said
Morar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord knows, I made no pretence at angelic
virtues, and &rsquo;twas there, by my faith, I was different from
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the coward and liar too!&rdquo; cried
his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were far too cunning <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>to show me
what you really were, and it must have been a woeful ignorance of
the world that made me take you on your own estimate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, the mistake has been on both sides,&rdquo;
said Morar.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one could be more
astonished than myself that my real wife should be so different
from what till this hour I had imagined her.&nbsp; Madam, you
need not be so noisy; if you scream a little louder the crew will
be let into a pretty secret.&nbsp; It is like enough they know
you already, for I have been singularly blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put up what seemed to her for the first time an unlovely
hand to stifle a forced yawn: she saw an appalling cruelty in the
mouth that had so often kissed her and called her sweet names;
his very attitude expressed contempt for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; she asked, distracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not what you have done,&rdquo; he said <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>with a
coarse deliberation, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis what you are and what you
cannot help being.&nbsp; The repentance must lie with me.&nbsp; I
would give, gaily, ten years of my life to obliterate the past
six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, &rsquo;tis a man of grace and character says so
to his newly-married wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Morar started slightly, and looked for a moment
confused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Newly married!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Lord
help us! so we are.&nbsp; Some way, I fancied we had been married
for years.&nbsp; Well, we have not taken long to discover each
other, and will have the more leisure to repent.&nbsp; I
understand you, madam, into the very core; there is not a vein of
your body hides a secret from me.&nbsp; I was mistaken; I thought
your beauty something more than a pink cheek; I thought you
generous till I saw how generous you could be at my expense, and
how much the rent-roll of Morar weighed with you in your decision
to marry me.&nbsp; I thought you humble and unaffected, <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>and now I
see you posing about this business of bare feet on the sand, the
morning breeze in your gown, breakfasts of berries and
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray go on,&rdquo; cried the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray go
on.&nbsp; Every word you say confirms the character I now see in
your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you truthful, so you are&mdash;in the letter
and the word; but the flattery you have for those you would
conciliate, the insincerity of your laugh in the presence of
those you would please, the unscrupulousness of your excuses for
the omission of duties unpleasant to you&mdash;what are these but
lies of the worst kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh heavens,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I was not always
so!&nbsp; If I am so now I must be what you made me.&nbsp; I
remember&mdash;&rdquo; she drew her hand across her brow;
&ldquo;I seem to remember some one else I thought was me, that
loved you, and could not be too good and pure for you even in her
imagination.&nbsp; You seemed a king to that poor foolish <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>girl&rsquo;s imagination; she loved you so&mdash;she
loved you so, she was so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; said Morar.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had,
seemingly, well deceived yourself.&nbsp; And now I can tell you
that you may cry your eyes out, for I know what a woman gets her
tears so readily for.&nbsp; It is that when she is crying and
lamenting she may not betray her chagrin and ill-temper in her
face.&nbsp; Have done with it, and let us get out of this!&nbsp;
I see the men put out the boat; they will be with us in a moment;
for Heaven&rsquo;s sake let us have no more theatricals.&nbsp;
The fate of us both is sealed, and we must, I suppose, live the
rest of our lives together like the other married fools we
know&mdash;putting as fair a face as we can on a ghastly
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was standing beside tall blades of shelister&mdash;the
iris of the isles&mdash;and when he spoke like this to her she
suddenly plucked a handful and began to tear them wantonly with
her fingers.</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>&ldquo;I assure you that you have seen the last of my
tears,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would not cry out if you
struck me!&nbsp; There is something almost as sweet as love, and
that is hate, and I seem to have come from a race that must have
either.&nbsp; I have a feeling in me that I could have loved
eternally if I had found the proper object, but now I know that I
can always be sure you will keep me hating, and I am not
sorry.&nbsp; Yes, yes, you have said it, Morar, a ghastly
business; but I will not put any fair face on it to deceive the
world, I assure you!&nbsp; It could not be deceived: blind would
it be, indeed, if it could not see the sneer in your face, and
hear the coward in your voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, you fool; the men are coming!&rdquo; he said,
clutching at her wrist and twisting it cruelly.</p>
<p>She gave a little shriek of pain, and caught at her breast
with the other hand that held the broken blades of
shelisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have struck me!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>&ldquo;That
is the end of my shame, and I shall make you suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw a poignard glint momentarily in the morning sun that
was turning Isle Faoineas&rsquo; sands to gold, and before he
could prevent her she had plunged the weapon in her bosom.&nbsp;
She fell with a cry at his feet, her hair in the ashes of the
fire they had last night sat by.&nbsp; The blood came bubbling to
her mouth and welled out on her bosom where the poignard rose and
fell with her moaning.</p>
<p>For a moment, instead of pity and remorse, there was a feeling
of release.&nbsp; Behind him sounded the plash of oars; he turned
hastily and saw the men had left the sloop and were approaching
land.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh <i>Dhia</i>!&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a bonny business to explain!&rdquo; and then
&rsquo;twas very far from well with Morar, for he heard the woman
moan her wish for water, and he knew she shared the agony of that
inward fire that scorched his throat as if the berries he had
swallowed had been beads of heated metal.&nbsp; <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>At his feet
was the glass they had drunk from on the last night of their
happiness; he picked it up and ran to the well that tinkled on
the hillock, then hurried to her side and raised her up to let
her drink.</p>
<p>The draught, it seemed, revived her; she shuddered and sighed,
and turned in his arms; then his own torment mastered him, and he
drank too.</p>
<p>Through his whole flesh went a pleasant chill; a gladness
danced in him, and he saw a thing miraculous in his
bride&mdash;the flush come back to her cheek, and all her wild
sweet beauty, and her smile, as she leaned against his shoulder
like one new waked from sleep, so that he looked into her face
and saw himself reflected in her eyes.&nbsp; The berry stains
were on her lips, the bosom of her gown was reddened with their
juices, and in between her breasts lay the blade of the
shelister, sparkling with dew, and glinting in the sunshine as it
rose and fell in time with her heart&rsquo;s pulsations.</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>&ldquo;Oh, love!&rdquo; she said, and put her arms
about his neck, &ldquo;I dreamt&mdash;I dreamt a dreadful
dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, sweetheart,&rdquo; said Morar, looking aghast at
the berry stains, and the mark of his fingers on her wrist, and
on the iris blade that were evidence it had been no dream.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I dreamt, too, love&mdash;my God! such dreaming!&nbsp; I
do not wonder now the world holds far aloof from this Island of
Illusion.&nbsp; God bless the well, the holy well; but the curse
of curses on the berries of Ealan Faoineas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together, hand in hand, they fled to the shore and waded out
on the sandy shallow to meet the boat; the sloop shook out her
sails like some proud eager bird; from her deck, together
waist-encircled, they saw the blue tide rise on the yellow sands,
the trees nod, the birds flit among the thickets of the glen, and
heard the tinkle of the well in Ealan Faoineas.</p>
<h2><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>THE
TUDOR CUP.</h2>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span><span
class="smcap">When</span> the Tudor Cup was sold at
Sotheby&rsquo;s in the year 18&ndash; for the sum of &pound;7000,
the fall of the auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer echoed round the
world&mdash;at all events, round the world of men who gather
bibelots.&nbsp; There were only three such treasures in
existence&mdash;this one now destined for America, which was
understood to have come from Holland; another in the national
collection in Paris; and a third in Scotland, the property of Sir
Gilbert Quair, whose ancestor had acquired it one hundred and
fifty years before by winning a game of cards in a London
coffee-house.</p>
<p>Among those people who were profoundly moved by this record
price for a quite <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>unimpressive-looking battered silver tankard was the
firm of Harris and Hirsch, the Bond Street art-dealers; and two
days after the sale in London, Mr Harris hastened up to Scotland,
quartered himself at an inn in Peebles, and pushed some discreet
inquiries.&nbsp; Sir Gilbert Quair, he discovered, was in a state
approaching penury, living an almost hermit life in the House of
Quair beside the Tweed, with a deaf old housekeeper, a half-daft
maid who never came out of doors, and an equally recluse man
whose duty it was to act as guide to the numerous tourists who
flocked to the house for the sake of its place in Ballad
Ministrelsy and its antiquarian collection.&nbsp; If the gossips
of Peebles could be trusted, the baronet lived upon the shilling
fees his guide exacted from the visitors, dodging, himself, from
room to room of his mansion for fear of encountering Americans
and English, whom he hated&mdash;resenting their intrusion on his
privacy, but counting their <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>numbers eagerly as from his window
he watched them coming up the long yew avenue.</p>
<p>Harris, the Bond Street dealer, modestly bent on hiding his
own importance in the commercial world of art&mdash;for the nonce
a simple English gentleman with a taste for
miniatures&mdash;called next day at the House of Quair, whose
crenellated tower looked arrogantly over ancient woods and fields
where lambs were bleating piteously and men were walking along
the furrows scattering seed.</p>
<p>The avenue of yews, which led from the highway into Peebles
through neglected and dishevelled grounds, brought the Bond
Street dealer to the forlorn fa&ccedil;ade of the mansion and the
great main door.&nbsp; He rapped upon the iron knocker; the sound
reverberated as through a vault, with hollow echoes such as come
from vacant chambers.&nbsp; Far back in the dwelling&rsquo;s core
there was a clatter of something fallen, <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>but no one
answered to the summons of the visitor; and having rapped in vain
again, he ventured round the westward wing, to find himself
confronted by a door on the side of which was hung the evidence
that this was properly his entrance.&nbsp; It was a painted
board, with the legend&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">QUAIR COLLECTION.<br />
Open to the Public Tuesdays and Thursdays.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ADMISSION ONE SHILLING.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this was neither a Tuesday nor a Thursday, and Harris
swore softly.&nbsp; He was just on the point of making his
retreat when a footstep sounded on the gravel of a little walk
that led to a bower upon the terrace, and turning, he found
himself face to face with Sir Gilbert Quair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The collection is not on view to-day, sir,&rdquo; said
the baronet, an elderly thickset gentleman wearing a shabby suit
of tweed.</p>
<p>Mr Harris took off his hat&mdash;not to the <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>wearer of
the shabby tweed suit, but to the owner of the Tudor Cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am most unfortunate,&rdquo; he stammered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was not aware that the collection was only on view on
certain days, and, unhappily, I must return to England this
evening.&nbsp; It happens that I am something of an amateur in
miniatures, fortunate in the possession of a few choice examples,
and, being in this neighbourhood, I could not resist the
temptation to see the celebrated collection of Sir Gilbert Quair,
which is rich in miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed the baronet his card, to which the name of a
well-known London club contributed the proper degree of
uncommercial importance.&nbsp; Sir Gilbert turned it over in his
fingers with a little hesitation, shot a shy glance of the
keenest scrutiny from under his bushy eyebrows at the
visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the circumstances&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and taking
a key from his pocket, unlocked the door which led to the
collection, but before <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>he let his visitor through he held
out to him a little wooden box with a slit in the lid of
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the absence of the usual guide,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll collect your shilling for him, Mr
Harris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later Harris was manifesting the most rapturous
appreciation of Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s miniatures, which in truth
were nothing wonderful; but at every opportunity, when unobserved
by his host, his eyes went ranging in search of the Tudor
Cup.&nbsp; It was his host who finally called attention to it
under glass in a corner cupboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had been interested in old English silver, Mr
Harris, this piece might have had some attraction,&rdquo; said
Sir Gilbert, drenching his flaring nostrils with a pinch of snuff
from a tiny ivory spoon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no great judge
myself, but my father highly prized it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bond Street dealer, with a thudding heart, peered through
the glass at the very <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>counterpart of that tarnished goblet
which had fetched &pound;7000 in Sotheby&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was
wondering if the dry, old, shabby gentleman looking over his
shoulder, and odorous with macconba, was aware that this was a
Tudor Cup, or if he had read the newspapers carefully and knew
what Tudor Cups were worth in Sotheby&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>II.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;But Himmel! did you not make him an offer?&rdquo;
demanded Hirsch next day in the Bond Street shop&mdash;they
called it gallery&mdash;to which his partner had returned from
Tweedside with the profound depression a man might have who had
for a fleeting moment seen the only woman he could ever love and
then had lost her in a panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offer, Joel!&rdquo; he replied in accents of
despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I offered him five thousand, and he only
chuckled.&nbsp; He would not even take it from the
cupboard.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no, Mr Harris,&rsquo; he said with his
head to the side, flicking up his abominable snuff; &lsquo;it is
an heirloom older than any here, and I am <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>not
selling.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the galling thing is that he
doesn&rsquo;t even know he has a Tudor Cup, nor what a Tudor Cup
can fetch in Sotheby&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you should have had the money with you,
Harris,&rdquo; said his partner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always show the
money, I say; it talks for you through a speaking-trumpet.&nbsp;
By heavens, I will go myself to Scotland and have that Tudor Cup,
if I have to steal it!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>III.</h3>
<p>A spirit of romance and a solemn homily on mutability were in
the scene when Hirsch walked into the grounds of Quair, though he
was not the man to understand.&nbsp; Six hundred years of history
cried from the old bastion; still in its shelter men sowed oats,
and their shabby dwellings clustered, no way changed, to look at,
since the Borderland was vexed with wars and Quair was lord and
warden; but vassals no more, save to that grim seigneur Commerce,
who took from them triple-tithes and children instead of the
service of the sword, which was all the old lords claimed.&nbsp;
A valley of peace, and nights untroubled, and the old bold
fighting Quairs in their resting graves, and <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>their
troopers&rsquo; dust at the roots of English pastures; surely at
eve in the woods of Quair, or riding spirit horses through the
passes of the hills, a thousand ghosts went seeking lost
passions, old delights.</p>
<p>It was Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; Hirsch stepped in at the door
which led to the Quair Collection, to find the man in charge of
it had all the customary cicerone&rsquo;s dull loquacity.&nbsp;
He dribbled dates and gushed details of family history as if he
were a gargoyle who had never got refreshment from the currents
pouring through him.&nbsp; Thick-set, short, and rasped upon the
chin from too-close shaving, he looked the very figure of a man
to fill one of the empty suits of mail that flanked the entrance
to the gallery, and even to the shopman&rsquo;s eye of Hirsch he
had an air of truculence that somehow seemed to accord with the
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not appear to have many visitors to-day,&rdquo;
said the picture-dealer, having looked perfunctorily at dingy
tapestry and <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>pictures, and now with eyes, in which the fires of
covetousness were with difficulty restrained, upon the tarnished
Tudor Cup in its corner cupboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re the first this week,&rdquo; said the guide
with acerbity, as if the shilling feed were a more personal
matter than the gossips of the countryside believed; and Hirsch
the dealer, rubbing his hook-nose to conceal the tremulous
avidity of his mouth, saw that disappointed avarice was in this
creature&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like, a little later on, to see Sir
Gilbert,&rdquo; said the dealer, who had five thousand pounds in
his pocket, and a Jew&rsquo;s conviction that an impecunious Scot
could never resist the delicious crackle of English notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye canna; he&rsquo;s from home,&rdquo; explained the
guide.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awa&rsquo; to Edinburgh for a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought came there and then to the dealer which made him
pale.&nbsp; Avarice and <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>cunning were in the old man&rsquo;s
face; his shillings plainly meant a lot to him; his clothing was
in poor accord with the guardianship of treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Hirsch in a confidential
whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your master is to be away for a month,
there is no reason why the matter I meant to arrange with him
should not be arranged with you, and put a handsome sum of money
in your pocket.&nbsp; I have taken a fancy to this silver jug,
and though I know Sir Gilbert will not part with it, I thought he
might at least agree to let me have it copied.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
thing that is often done, Mr&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meldrum,&rdquo; said the guide with a promising air of
equanimity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In two or three weeks I could have my copy made in
Paris, and this cup returned to you in safety, and no one else
except ourselves need be a bit the wiser, Mr Meldrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide gave a laugh that was half a <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>sneer, and
checked it suddenly with a hand upon his mouth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a maist singular proposition,&rdquo; he
remarked reflectively.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the four-and-twenty years
I have been showin&rsquo; folk the Quair Collection I havena
heard the like of it.&nbsp; And it comes from a total
stranger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I represent one of the most reputable firms in
London,&rdquo; Hirsch hastened to explain, with the simultaneous
production of his business card.</p>
<p>Meldrum looked at it with interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Harris &amp;
Hirsch.&nbsp; I take it that you are Mr Hirsch?&nbsp; There was a
Mr Harris calling on Sir Gilbert, I was tell&rsquo;t, some days
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; answered Hirsch.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
partner.&nbsp; He had almost completed negotiations for the loan
of the cup for the purpose I have mentioned.&nbsp; But really
there seems no need for us to be troubling Sir Gilbert.&nbsp; The
cup will be back before his return from Edinburgh,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;Just that!&rdquo; said Meldrum dryly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what about my security?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delighted with such apparent pliability, Hirsch produced his
English notes, which brought a very passion of greed to
Meldrum&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us not be calling it security, Mr Meldrum,&rdquo;
he remarked insidiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;If a hundred
pounds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the guide ironically chuckled.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I could
trust ye for a hundred pounds, Mr Hirsch, I could trust ye mair
for ten times that,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I take your word
for&rsquo;t that we needna ca&rsquo;t security: if I&rsquo;m to
risk my job and my reputation, the cost of three weeks loan
o&rsquo; that siller tankard is exactly a thousand
pounds!&rdquo;</p>

.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>Three weeks later, the Quair Cup and its duplicate came back
from Tregastel of Paris, so much alike that Hirsch would have
been beat to see a difference had it not been that <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>he found on
one a private microscopic mark he had put on it himself.</p>
<p>But it was not the cup so marked that he returned to the
accommodating Meldrum.</p>
<p>Two months more, and the curio world was shaken once again by
the intimation of another Tudor Cup for sale at
Sotheby&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Amongst the host of possible bidders who
examined the precious piece of tarnished metal taken out
impressively from Sotheby&rsquo;s strongest safe some days before
the sale, was Barraclough, the expert who had bought its fellow
earlier in the season for his client in America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brilliant forgery,&rdquo; he exclaimed on careful
scrutiny&mdash;&ldquo;one of Jules Tregastel&rsquo;s charming
reproductions,&rdquo; and departed.</p>
<p>Harris and Hirsch were sent for by the auctioneer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; they protested&mdash;and Hirsch satisfied
himself again that the microscopic mark of the veritable cup from
Quair was there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tregastel never had a tool on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better ask?&rdquo; said the
auctioneer, and they asked by telegram, with astounding
consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cup you sent was a copy made a year ago by myself
for another client.&nbsp; I thought you knew,&rdquo; replied
Tregastel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mein Gott!&rdquo; cried Harris, appalled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tregastel has made so cunning a job of it he has even
copied your private mark, and you have sent the original back to
Quair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not believe it!&nbsp; I will not believe
it!&rdquo; said his partner, almost weeping with chagrin.</p>
<p>That night the two of them went to Scotland, and in the
morning Harris went out from Peebles to the House of Quair to see
Sir Gilbert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I have another look at the cup?&rdquo; he asked
without periphrasis, and the baronet snuffed and chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to have wonderfully taken your fancy, Mr
Harris,&rdquo; he remarked with an <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>ironic cough.&nbsp; &ldquo;Again you
are unfortunate in the day you call, for this is Wednesday.&nbsp;
And in any case I thought I made it clear that the cup was bound
to stay here in spite of your most tempting offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied the dealer; &ldquo;but I should
like to see it&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you mad collectors!&rdquo; said Sir Gilbert
humorously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye can be as crazy over a bashed old
siller cup as I might have been mysel&rsquo; at one time over a
bonny lassie!&nbsp; Well, come your ways in and you shall see
it.&nbsp; It is aye another shillin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris not only saw the cup, but this time got it into his
hands.&nbsp; In a fever of apprehension he turned it up and down
and sought for a microscopic mark like that which Hirsch had
pointed out upon the other,&mdash;it was not there!</p>
<p>At the sight of the blank look on his face Sir Gilbert
chuckled and took snuff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see you have discovered,
Mr Harris,&rdquo; he remarked with his eyebrows twitching.&nbsp;
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;You connoisseurs are not to be deceived so
easily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then you know it is a forgery!&rdquo; cried
Harris with amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not use that word for it exactly, Mr
Harris,&rdquo; said the baronet with a gesture of distaste.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A copy&mdash;and a wonderful copy too, by Tregastel of
Paris.&nbsp; The truth is, I sold the original some months ago in
London, having first had this one made.&nbsp; You see my
possession of a Tudor Cup is notorious, and if it got about that
the Quair Collection was being in any way depleted, where would
our shillin&rsquo;s come from, Mr Harris?&rdquo; and he jocosely
poked his visitor in the ribs.</p>
<p>Harris flew back to the inn at Peebles, an object of
unutterable despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mein Gott! these Scotch!&rdquo; cried Hirsch, wringing
his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I will have my money back from that
Meldrum man if I have to take him to the courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harris and Hirsch would cut a funny <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>figure in
the courts in the circumstances, Joel,&rdquo; said his
partner.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is better that we go out together
to-morrow, when your Meldrum&rsquo;s place is open, and
compromise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entrance to the Quair Collection had been hardly opened on
the morrow when the dealers tried to push their way within.&nbsp;
Harris was perturbed when he saw who checked them on the
threshold&mdash;Sir Gilbert Quair himself, who greeted him with a
crafty smile, only a little shabbier in dress than when he had
seen him hitherto, and with the box for the admission shillings
hanging round his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be the flowin&rsquo; bowl, Mr Harris,&rdquo;
he exclaimed ironically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye come back so often to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a word or two with you,&rdquo; said Mr Hirsch
peremptorily, finding the old man barred their further
passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you know that cup you lent me was an
imitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could hardly fail to be aware of it,&rdquo; <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>said the
baronet.&nbsp; &ldquo;You surely didna think a paltry thousand
pounds would be security for a genuine Tudor Cup, and a&rsquo;
the world sae keen on them at Sotheby&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been deceived; I must have my money back!&rdquo;
said Hirsch, and the old man shrugged his shoulders and took
snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Na, na!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bargain&rsquo;s
aye a bargain, and ye canna get your money back.&nbsp; The best I
can dae for ye is to swop the cup ye sent for the one I lent
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Meldrum&mdash;&rdquo; Hirsch began, and
Harris, with surprise, corrected him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Meldrum,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir
Gilbert Quair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re both of ye right, and ye&rsquo;re both of
ye wrang,&rdquo; said the old man with a chuckle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For twa years back I&rsquo;ve been guide to my own
collection; it&rsquo;s the only way to keep an eye upon the
shillin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You d&mdash;d old rogue!&rdquo; exclaimed the partners
simultaneously, and he grinned at them, with his stout old breast
across the <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>doorway like a cliff.&nbsp; For a little he gloated on
their fury, then took them by the arms and led them out upon the
terrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see this land,&rdquo; he said, and indicated all
the hills and valleys, verdant woods and furrowed fields, and the
river sounding at the bend below the mansion.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
greed of English thieves brought them here marauding for good six
hundred years, and it seems ye&rsquo;re no done yet!&nbsp; My
forefolk fought you with the sword, but Gilbert Meldrum Quair
must fight you with his wits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Gott in Himmel! we are not English; we are
Hebrews!&rdquo; protested Hirsch with his hands palm upwards and
his neck contracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is worse,&rdquo; replied Sir Gilbert, making for
his door.&nbsp; &ldquo;We Scots are still at feud wi&rsquo; the
Jews for what they did out yonder in Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>

class="smcap">When</span> I go home on summer visitations, old
friends, with the most generous desire to aid one in an eccentric
and indeed half-daft and wholly disreputable way of living, come
to me covertly in reckless moments &ldquo;for auld lang
syne,&rdquo; and remind me of native characters ancient or
modern.&nbsp; They themselves are (if they only knew it)
characters the most superb for any of my purposes, but, wholly
unsuspecting, they narrate the whims and oddities, the follies
and conceits of others, lamenting always that the race of
characters is rapidly running done.&nbsp; &ldquo;When <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Jiah, and
Jocka, and Old Split-a-dale are gone,&rdquo; say they,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll can take to reading your own bits of stories,
for there&rsquo;ll be nothing better left to do, and not a ploy

<p>I know better, of course.&nbsp; I know that unconventional
characters&mdash;fantastic, whimsical, bombastic, awkward,
crazed&mdash;will come to the surface there and elsewhere as
constant as the bracken comes upon the braes in spring.</p>
<p>But age, undoubtedly, whether it matures an oddity or not,
endears him to you if yours be the proper sympathetic soul for
such caprices of the stars.&nbsp; What in a droll
&ldquo;going-about body&rdquo; of thirty seems a rogue&rsquo;s
impertinence will appear to some one else, thirty years after
this, or even to yourself perhaps, a quaint wit, and his sayings
and doings will be the cause of merriment over all the
countryside.&nbsp; So it is that even I am sometimes constrained
to think <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>the old characters dead and gone will never have such
brilliant successors.</p>
<p>I had that thought yesterday as I walked past
Copenhagen&rsquo;s school.&nbsp; Alas! not Copenhagen&rsquo;s
school, for Copenhagen wields no earthly ferrule, and lies with
many of his pupils under grass in Kilmailie, and the little
thatched academy, where we drowsed in summer, and choked in
winter in the smoke of our own individual peats, is but a huddle
of stones, hidden by nettles, humbled in the shade of the
birch-tree from which old Copenhagen culled the pliant and
sibilant switch for our more noisy than unpleasant
castigation.&nbsp; But there, persistent as are the roads old
hunters made upon the hills of long ago, as are the ways our
fathers went to market through glens for years untenanted, was
the path we youngsters made between the highway and old
Copenhagen&rsquo;s school!</p>
<p>Is it conceivable, I ask my old companions of that hillside
seminary, that Copenhagen <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>should be dead?&nbsp; That a time
should come when his thin, long, bent figure, carried on one of
his own legs and one (as went our tradition) cut from an ash in
the wood of Achnatra, should dart about the little school no
more, and his tales of Nelson and the sea be all concluded?</p>
<p>He had been twenty years in the Navy, and had seen but a
single engagement&mdash;the one that gave him his byname, and
cost him his leg.&nbsp; He came home with a pension, and settled
in his native parish.&nbsp; He was elderly; he was&mdash;as we
should think it now&mdash;ill-educated; he was without wife or
child of his own; he had at times the habit of ran-dan, as we
call a convivial rollicking.&nbsp; Heaven plainly meant him for a
Highland school, and so he opened one&mdash;this same, so lowly
to-day among the nettles.&nbsp; Of the various things he taught,
the most I can remember (besides reading, which came, I fear,
more by nature than by Copenhagen&rsquo;s teaching) was the
geography of the Baltic, <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>the graphic fact that Horatio Nelson
nearly always wore a grey surtout, three ways of tying knots, and
a song of epic character called &ldquo;The Plains of
Waterloo.&rdquo;&nbsp; What would perhaps be called a
&ldquo;special subject&rdquo; nowadays was the art he taught us
of keeping birds from cherry-trees.&nbsp; The cherry-trees grew
up the front of Copenhagen&rsquo;s bachelor dwelling-house, half
a mile from the school.&nbsp; When the fruit reddened, every
scholar in the school (we numbered twelve or fourteen) rose at
dawn for days and sat below the cherry-trees chanting a Gaelic
incantation that never failed to keep away the predatory
thrush.&nbsp; The odd thing was that Copenhagen, in spite of
these precautions, never got a single cherry, and did not seem to
care.&nbsp; We ate the cherries as they ripened, relieving each
other alternately of the incantation; he came out to praise us
for our industry, and never cast a glance aloft.</p>
<p>The fees for Copenhagen&rsquo;s college were <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>uncertain&mdash;not only in payment, but in
amount.&nbsp; When our parents asked him what was to pay for Bob
or Sandy, the antique pensioner blew his nose with noisy
demonstration, and invariably answered, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know what we&rsquo;ll need till we see what we&rsquo;ll
require.&rdquo;&nbsp; His requirements were manifestly few, for
three-fourths of the pupils contributed nothing to the upkeep of
the school but a diurnal peat in winter, and the others had their
fees wholly expended on pens and paper for themselves when the
flying stationer came round twice a year.</p>
<p>We grew to like and to respect old Copenhagen, knowing nothing
of his ran-dans, that were confined to the town six miles away,
and never were allowed to interfere with his duty to his
pupils.&nbsp; He made no brilliant scholars, but he gave us a
thousand pleasant, droll, and kindly memories that go far as a
substitute for a superficial knowledge of Greek.&nbsp; I would <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>myself have
learned the cutlass from him, being the oldest of the pupils and
the likeliest to make a good practitioner of that noble marine
weapon; but, unhappily, I left the school and started my career
in town the very day he had unearthed the sword and brought it
forth for my first lesson.</p>
<p>It was there I learned that Copenhagen was the church
precentor, and had his little vices, whereof our folks at home,
with wisdom and delicacy, had never given us a hint.&nbsp; He
used to come down to town each Sunday in a pair of
tightly-strapped breeches, a black surtout, and what we called a
three-storey hat.&nbsp; The preacher chose the psalm, but it was
Copenhagen chose the tune.&nbsp; He had but half a dozen airs in
all his repertory&mdash;Selma, Dundee, Martyrdom, Coleshill, and
Dunfermline, and what he called &ldquo;yon one of my
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have sometimes been to the opera since; I
fear, from knowledge gained by that experience, that the old man
was not highly <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>gifted for vocalism.&nbsp; Invariably he started on too
high a key, and found that he had done so only when a bar or two
was finished.&nbsp; With imperturbability unfailing, he just
stopped short, and, leaning over his desk, said to the
congregation, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have another try at it,
lads!&rdquo;&nbsp; The service was an English one, but this
touching confidence was in Gaelic, and addressed particularly to
the men who, married or single, sat apart from the women.</p>
<p>While Copenhagen still led the praise to Coleshill and
&ldquo;yon one of his own,&rdquo; a pestilent innovator came to
the place who knew music, and, unhappily, introduced a band of
enterprising youths to the mysteries of harmony.&nbsp; He taught
them bass and alto, and showed them how the melody of Dundee and
Coleshill could be embellished and improved by those.&nbsp; The
first Sunday these vocalists started to display their new art in
the church, Copenhagen stopped in the middle of a verse to make a
protest.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have none of your boom-boom singing
here to put me all reel-rall,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;nor praising
of the Lord with such theatricals,&rdquo; then baffled them by
changing the air to &ldquo;yon one of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bachelor by prejudice and conviction, he liked to hear of
marriages, and when the &ldquo;cries&rdquo; were read he had for
long&mdash;until a new incumbent made a protest&mdash;a cheerful,
harmless habit of crying at the end of the announcement, &ldquo;I
have no objections to&rsquo;t whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new incumbent was less tolerant than his predecessor; to
him was due the old man&rsquo;s retirement from the office of
conductor of the psalmody.&nbsp; He would not countenance the
ran-dans, nor consent to the perpetuation of Copenhagen&rsquo;s
ancient manners in the precentor&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp; First of all
he claimed the right of intimating the tunes as well as the
psalms to be sung to them, and sought thereby to put an end to
the unseemly &ldquo;yon one of my own&rdquo;; but <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>Copenhagen
started what air he pleased, no matter what was intimated, and
more often than before it was his own creation.&nbsp; Then were
thrust upon the old man wooden boards with the names of half a
dozen psalm tunes printed on them.&nbsp; They were to be
displayed in front of the desk as required, and thus save all
necessity for any verbal intimation.&nbsp; But Copenhagen
generally showed them upside down, and still maintained his
vested rights to start what airs he chose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
we agreed on Martyrdom in the vestry,&rdquo; said the minister
once, exasperated into a protest in front of the congregation
when Copenhagen started &ldquo;yon one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So we
did, so we did&mdash;I mind fine; but I shifted my mind,&rdquo;
said Copenhagen, looking up, and cleared his throat to start
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said he to sympathisers
in the afternoon, &ldquo;upon my word the man&rsquo;s a fair
torment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Copenhagen&rsquo;s most notable ran-dans were after he had
demitted office as <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>musician, out of patience at last with the
&ldquo;torment.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were such guileless, easily
induced excesses, so marked by an incongruous propriety, that I
hesitate to speak of them as more than innocent
exhilarations.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas then his surtout was most spick
and span, his manner most urbane and engaging.&nbsp; The poorest
gangrel who addressed him on the highway then was
&ldquo;sir&rdquo; to Copenhagen, and a boy had but to look at him
to be assured of a halfpenny.&nbsp; His timber leg went tapping
over the causeways then with an illusive haste, for it was
Copenhagen&rsquo;s wish to be thought a man immersed profoundly
in affairs.&nbsp; He spoke in his finest English (reserved for
moments of importance) of the Admiralty, and he never entered the
inn without having in his hand a large packet of blue envelopes
tied with a boot-lace, to suggest important and delicate
negotiations with some messenger from the First Lord.&nbsp; Once,
I remember, he came out of the inn with a suspicious-looking <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>bulge in
the tail-pocket of his surtout.&nbsp; As he passed the Beenickie
and Jock Scott and me standing at the factor&rsquo;s corner, and
punctiliously returned the naval salute he always looked for from
his own old pupils, a &ldquo;Glenorchy pint&rdquo; (as it was
called) fell out of his pocket in the street, without suffering
any damage.&nbsp; He never paused a moment or looked round, and
the Beenickie cried after him, &ldquo;You have dropped something,
Mr Bain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is just a trifle, lads,&rdquo; he
answered without looking back; &ldquo;I will get it when I
return,&rdquo; and pursued his way to his house, six miles
away.&nbsp; He was ashamed, I suppose, of the exposure.</p>
<p>Another time&mdash;on the night of St John&rsquo;s, when the
local Freemasons had their flambeau march, and every boy who
carried a torch got threepence on production of its stump the
following day (which induced some to cut their stumps in two, and
so get sixpence)&mdash;I saw old Copenhagen falling down an
outside stair.&nbsp; I hastened to his <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>assistance,
suffering sincere alarm and pity for my ancient dominie.&nbsp; He
was, luckily, little the worse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was coming down in
any case, John,&rdquo; said he benignly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man! I am
always vexed I never learned you the fencing with the cutlass,
for you were a promising lad.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry too,
Mr Bain,&rdquo; said I, though indeed I could not see that a
clerk in a law office would find the accomplishment in question
of much use to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew your Uncle Jamie,&rdquo;
he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him and me was pretty chief.&nbsp; You
will say nothing about my bit of a glide, John: I was coming down
at any rate, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should like my last reminiscence of old Copenhagen to be
more reputable, for his own last words in gossiping of any one,
no matter how foolish or vile, were always generous.&nbsp; And I
recall a day when he came from his distant seminary through deep
drifts of snow to the town to post a letter that he wished me to
revise first.&nbsp; <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>The &lsquo;Courier&rsquo; of the
week was full of tales of misery among our troops in the Crimean
trenches, and Copenhagen&rsquo;s sympathies were fired.&nbsp; His
letter was a suggestion to the Admiralty that in these times of
stress it might help my Lords a little if they were relieved of
the payment of the pension of Archibald Bain, late of H.M.S.
<i>Elephant</i>.&nbsp; He was very old, and frail, and tremulous
in these days; his hand of write would have sorely puzzled any
one but me, who knew so well its eccentricities.&nbsp; His folly
touched me to the core; I knew his object, but for the life of me
I could not read his letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be a mistake to send it, Mr
Bain,&rdquo; I said, when he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Havers!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I want you to
tell me is if it is shipshape and Bristol fashion, eh? and not
likely to give offence.&nbsp; Read it, man, read it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it out to me yourself, Mr Bain,&rdquo; I
stammered, &ldquo;the thing&rsquo;s beyond me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put on his spectacles and looked <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>closely at
his own scrawl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare to you,&rdquo; he said in
a little, laughingly, &ldquo;I declare to you I cannot read a
word of her myself.&nbsp; But no matter, John, we&rsquo;ll just
let her go as she stands; they&rsquo;re better scholars in London
than what we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter went, but I never heard that the British Admiralty
availed itself of an offer so unusual and kind.</p>
<p>I thought of these things yesterday as I passed the ruins of
Copenhagen&rsquo;s school.&nbsp; How far, since then, have
travelled the feet that trod there; how far, how weary, how
humbled, how elate, how prosperous, how shamefully down at
heel?&nbsp; Dear lads, dear girls, wherever you be, my old
companions, were we not here in this poor place, among the hazel
and the fern, most fortunate and happy?&nbsp; Has the wide world
we travel through for fame or fortune&mdash;or, better still,
content&mdash;added aught to us of joy we did not have (at least
in <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>memory) in those irrecoverable, enduring, summer
days?&nbsp; Now it is mist for ever on the hill, and the rain-rot
in the wood, and clouds and cares chasing each other across our
heavens, and flowers that flame from bud to blossom and smoulder
into dust almost before we have caught their perfume; then, old
friends, we pricked our days out leisurely upon a golden
calendar: the scent of the morning hay-fields seemed eternal.</p>
<h2><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>THE
SILVER DRUM.</h2>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span><span
class="smcap">Fifty</span> yards to the rear of the
dwelling-house the studio half hid itself amongst young elms and
laurel bushes, at its outside rather like a granary, internally
like a chapel, the timbers of the roof exposed and umber-stained,
with a sort of clerestory for the top light, a few casts of
life-size statues in the corners, and two or three large
bas-reliefs of Madonnas and the like by Donatello helping out the
ecclesiastical illusion.&nbsp; It was the last place to associate
with the sound of drums, and yet I sat for twenty minutes
sometimes stunned, sometimes fascinated, by the uproar of
asses&rsquo; skin.&nbsp; The sculptor who played might, by <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>one less
unconventional, be looked upon as seriously sacrificing his
dignity in a performance so incongruous with his age and
situation.&nbsp; But I have always loved the whimsical; I am
myself considered somewhat eccentric, and there is a
<i>rapport</i> between artistic souls that permits&mdash;indeed,
induces&mdash;some display of fantasy or folly when they get into
each other&rsquo;s society apart from the intolerant folks who
would think it lunacy for a man of over middle age to indulge in
the contre-dance of &ldquo;Petronella&rdquo; at a harvest-home,
or display any accomplishment with the jew&rsquo;s-harp.</p>
<p>Urquhart, at the time when I sat to him, was a man of sixty
years or thereabout; yet he marched up and down the floor of his
workshop with the step of a hill-bred lad, his whole body sharing
the rhythm of his beating, his clean-shaven face with the flush
of a winter apple, the more noticeable in contrast with the linen
smock he used as an overall while at work among <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>his
clay.&nbsp; The deep old-fashioned side-drum swinging at his
groin seemed to have none of a drum&rsquo;s monotony.&nbsp; It
expressed (at all events to me that have some fancy) innumerable
ecstasies and emotions&mdash;alarms, entreaties, defiances,
gaieties, and regrets, the dreadful sentiment of forlorn hopes,
the murmur of dubious battalions in countries of ambush.&nbsp;
The sound of the drum is, unhappily, beyond typographical
expression, though long custom makes us complacently accept
&ldquo;rat-a-tat-tat&rdquo; or &ldquo;rub-a-dub-dub&rdquo; as
quite explanatory of its every phrase and accent; but I declare
the sculptor brought from it the very pang of love.&nbsp;
Alternated with the martial uproar of rouses, retreats, chamades,
and marches that made the studio shake, it rose into the
clerestory and lingered in the shades of the umber roof, this
gentle combination of taps and <i>roulades</i>, like the appeal
of one melodiously seeking admission at his mistress&rsquo;s
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no idea that I handled sticks <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>so
terrifically?&rdquo; said he, relinquishing the instrument at
last, and returning to his proper task of recording my lineaments
in the preparatory clay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You play marvellously, Mr Urquhart,&rdquo; I said,
astonished.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had no idea you added the drum to
your&mdash;to your accomplishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there you have me revealed&mdash;something of a
compliment to you, I assure you, for I do not beat my drum for
everybody.&nbsp; If I play well it is, after all, no wonder, for
with a side-drum and a pair of sticks I earned a living for seven
years and travelled among the most notable scenes of
Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; I said, and waited.&nbsp; He pinched the
clay carefully to make the presentment of the lobe of my ear, and
stood back from his work a moment to study the effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;few people know of it; and
perhaps it is as well, for it might not be counted wholly to the
credit of an R.S.A. <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>if it were known; but for seven
years I played the side-drum in the ranks of the 71st.&nbsp; I
played from Torres Vedras to the Pyrenees, at Vimiera, Corunna,
Talavera, Busaco, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajos, Quatre Bras, and
Waterloo.&nbsp; Lord! the very names go dirling through my
heart.&nbsp; They were happy days, I assure you, when
I&mdash;when I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thumped the skin,&rdquo; I ventured foolishly, as he
paused to make a line of some importance on my effigy.</p>
<p>He corrected me with a vexed air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thumped, my dear sir, is scarcely the word I should use
under the circumstances.&nbsp; That hackneyed verb of every dolt
who has neither ear nor imagination should not be chosen by a
fellow-artist, a man of letters, to describe the roll of the
drum.&nbsp; My happiest days, as I was about to say, were when I
carried Kildalton&rsquo;s silver drum, for which this one is but
an indifferent substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least,&rdquo; said I lamely, &ldquo;the <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>drummer of
the 71st has gone pretty far in another art than
music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good of you to say so,&rdquo; remarked
Urquhart, with quiet dignity and an old-fashioned bow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I trust, by-and-by, with assiduity to become as good a
sculptor as I was a drummer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to join the Army?&rdquo; I asked,
anxious to have him follow up so promising an introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was a fool.&nbsp; Mind, I do not regret it,
for I had at the same time, in my folly, such memorable and happy
experiences as quite improperly (as you might think) never come
to the doorstep of the very wise.&nbsp; Still, I joined the Army
in a fool&rsquo;s escapade, resenting what seemed to me the
insufferable restrictions of a Scottish manse.&nbsp; My father
was incumbent of a parish, half Highland, half Lowland.&nbsp; At
sixteen I came home from Edinburgh and my first session of the
University there; at sixteen and a half I mutinied against <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>sixpence a
week of pocket-money and the prospect of the Divinity Hall for
one (as I felt) designed by Heaven for Art, and with a borrowed
name and an excellently devised tale of orphanhood, took a bounty
in the territorial regiment.&nbsp; They put me to the
drums.&nbsp; They professed to find me so well suited there that
they kept me at them all the time I was a King&rsquo;s man, in
spite of all my protests, and there, if you are in the mood for a
story, I had an experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The corps had two drums of silver, one of which was
entrusted to me.&nbsp; They were called &lsquo;Kildalton&rsquo;s
drums,&rsquo; in compliment to their donor, from whose lands no
fewer than four companies of the 71st had been embodied.&nbsp;
They were handsome instruments, used only for stately occasions,
and mine, at least, so much engaged my fancy that I liked to keep
it shining like a mirror; and the cords and tassels of
silk&mdash;pleated, as we were told, by Kildalton&rsquo;s
daughter&mdash;<a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>appealed so much to the dandiacal in me, I fretted to
have them wet on a parade.&nbsp; You can fancy, therefore, my
distress when my darling was subjected to the rough work and
hazards of the sack of Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our corps on that occasion was in the Light
Division.&nbsp; While Picton&rsquo;s men, away to our left and
nearer the river, were to attack the great breach made in the
ramparts by our guns on the Tessons, we were to rush into a
lesser breach farther east.&nbsp; The night was black and cold to
that degree I could not see the fortress at a hundred yards, and
could scarcely close my fingers on the drum-sticks as I beat for
the advance of Napier&rsquo;s storming party.&nbsp; The walls we
threatened burst in tongues of flame and peals of thunder.&nbsp;
Grape-shot tore through our three hundred as we crossed the
ditch; but in a moment we were in the gap, the bayonets busy as
it were among wine-skins, the footing slimy with blood, and a
single drum (my comrade fell mortally wounded <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>in the
ditch) beat inside the walls for the column outside to follow
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; I said, impatient, for Urquhart drew
back abstracted, checking his tale to survey the effect of his
last touch upon my eyebrows.</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I hardly thought it would
interest you,&rdquo; and then went on deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how quick
was our conquering of the French, once we had got through the
walls.&nbsp; My drum was not done echoing back from Sierra de
Francisca (as I think the name was), when the place was
ours.&nbsp; And then&mdash;and then&mdash;there came the
sack!&nbsp; Our men went mad.&nbsp; These were days when rapine
and outrage were to be expected from all victorious troops; there
might be some excuse for hatred of the Spaniard on the part of
our men, whose comrades, wounded, had been left to starve at
Talavera&mdash;but <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>surely not for this.&nbsp; They gorged with wine, they
swarmed in lawless squads through every street and alley; swept
through every dwelling, robbing and burning; the night in a while
was white with fires, and the town was horrible with shrieks and
random musket-shots and drunken songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time in the small hours of the morning, trying to
find my own regiment, I came with my drum to the head of what was
doubtless the most dreadful street that night in Europe.&nbsp; It
was a lane rather than a street, unusually narrow, with dwellings
on either side so high that it had some semblance to a mountain
pass.&nbsp; At that hour, if you will credit me, it seemed the
very gullet of the Pit: the far end of it in flames, the middle
of it held by pillagers who fought each other for the plunder
from the houses, while from it came the most astounding
noises&mdash;oaths in English and Portuguese, threats,
entreaties, and commands, the shrieks of women, the crackling <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>of burning
timber, occasionally the firing of weapons, and through it all,
constant, sad beyond expression, a deep low murmur, intensely
melancholy, made up of the wail of the sacked city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I stood listening some one called out,
&lsquo;Drummer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned, to find there had just come up a general
officer and his staff, with a picket of ten men.&nbsp; The
General himself stepped forward at my salute and put his hand on
my drum, that shone brightly in the light of the
conflagrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What the deuce do you mean, sir,&rsquo; said he
with heat, &lsquo;by coming into action with my brother&rsquo;s
drum?&nbsp; You know very well it is not for these
occasions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The ordinary drums of the regiment were lost on
Monday last, sir,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;when we were fording the
Agueda through the broken ice.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, with a
happy thought, I added, &lsquo;Kildalton&rsquo;s drums are none
the worse for taking part in the siege <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>of Ciudad
Rodrigo.&nbsp; This was the first drum through the
walls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked shrewdly at me and gave a little smile.&nbsp;
&lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;perhaps not, perhaps
not, after all.&nbsp; My brother would have been pleased, if he
had been alive, to know his drums were here this night.&nbsp;
Where is the other one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The last I saw of it, sir,&rsquo; I answered,
&lsquo;was in the ditch, and Colin Archibald, corporal, lying on
his stomach over it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dead, I think, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; said the General.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I hope my brother&rsquo;s drum&rsquo;s all right, at any
rate.&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned and cried up the picket.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I want you, drummer,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to go up that
lane with this picket, playing the assembly.&nbsp; You
understand?&nbsp; These devils fighting and firing there have
already shot at three of my officers, and are seemingly out of
their wits.&nbsp; We will give them a last chance.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t deny there is danger in what I ask <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>you to do,
but it has to be done.&nbsp; The men in there are mostly of
Pack&rsquo;s Portuguese and the dregs of our own corps.&nbsp; If
they do not come out with you I shall send in a whole regiment to
them and batter their brains out against the other end, if the
place is, as I fancy, a <i>cul-de-sac</i>.&nbsp;
March!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went before the picket with my drum rattling and my
heart in my mouth.&nbsp; The pillagers came round us jeering,
others assailed us more seriously by throwing from upper windows
anything they could conveniently lay hand on (assuming it was too
large or too valueless to pocket), but we were little the worse
till in a lamentable moment of passion one of the picket fired
his musket at a window.&nbsp; A score of pieces flashed back in
response, and five of our company fell, while we went at a double
for the end of the lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Heaven!&rsquo; cried the sergeant when we
reached it, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a fine thing!&rsquo;&nbsp; The
General had been right&mdash;it was a <i>cul-de-sac</i>!&nbsp; <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>There was
nothing for us then but to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never been in action; you cannot
imagine,&rdquo; Urquhart went on, &ldquo;the exasperating
influence of one coward in a squad that is facing great
danger.&nbsp; There were now, you must know, but six of us, hot
and reckless with anger, and prepared for anything&mdash;all but
one, and he was in the fear of death.&nbsp; As I went before the
picket drumming the assembly and the sergeant now beside me, this
fellow continually kicked my heels, he kept so close
behind.&nbsp; I turned my head, and found that he marched
crouching, obviously eager to have a better man than himself
sheltering him from any approaching bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You cowardly dog!&rsquo; I cried, stepping
aside, &lsquo;come out from behind me and die like a
man!&rsquo;&nbsp; I could take my oath the wretch was
sobbing!&nbsp; It made me sick to hear him, but I was saved more
thought of it by the rush of some women across the <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>lane,
shrieking as they ran, with half a company at least of Portuguese
at their heels.&nbsp; With a shout we were after Pack&rsquo;s
scoundrels, up a wide pend close (as we say in Scotland) that led
into a courtyard, where we found the valorosas prepared to defend
the position with pistol and sword.&nbsp; A whole battalion would
have hesitated to attack such odds, and I will confess we
swithered for a moment.&nbsp; A shot came from the dark end of
the entry and tore through both ends of my drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re wretched fools to be here at
all,&rsquo; said lily-liver, plainly whimpering, and at that I
threw down my outraged instrument, snatched his musket from him,
and charged up the close with the other four.&nbsp; The
Portuguese ran like rabbits; for the time, at least, the women
were safe, and I had a remorse for my beloved drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left the others to follow, hurried into the lane, and
found the poltroon was gone, my drum apparently with him.&nbsp;
Ciudad <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>Rodrigo was darker now, for the fires were burning
low.&nbsp; It was less noisy, too; and I heard half-way up the
lane the sound of a single musket-shot.&nbsp; I ran between the
tall tenements; the glint of bright metal filled me with hope and
apprehension.&nbsp; A man lay in the gutter beside my drum, and a
Portuguese marauder, who fled at my approach, stood over him with
a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man in the gutter was the General, with his
brother&rsquo;s drum slung to him, and the sticks in his hands,
as if he had been playing.&nbsp; He was unconscious, with a
bullet through his shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>II.</h3>
<p>Urquhart stopped his tale again, to wheel round the platform
on which I sat, so as to get me more in profile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks marvellously like stuff for a story,&rdquo;
I said to him as he set to work again upon the clay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My professional interests are fully aroused.&nbsp; Please
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am charmed to find you can be so easily
entertained,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all, what is
it?&nbsp; Merely a trifling incident.&nbsp; Every other man who
went through the Peninsular campaign came on experiences, I am
sure, far more curious.&nbsp; My little story would have ended in
the lane of Ciudad Rodrigo had not three companies of the
71st&mdash;mainly invalids after Badajos&mdash;been <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>sent to
Scotland for a whiff of their native air, and the fascination of
recruits.&nbsp; I had got a spent ball in the chest at
Badajos.&nbsp; I, too, had that gay vacation.&nbsp; I went with
my silver drum to the county it came from.&nbsp; It was glorious
summer weather.&nbsp; For three weeks we were billeted in the
county town; for a fortnight I would not have changed places with
King George himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Urquhart,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have a
premonition.&nbsp; Here comes in the essential lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sculptor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;comes in the
lady.&nbsp; There are, I find, no surprises for a novelist.&nbsp;
We were one day (to resume my story) in the burgh square, where a
market was being held, and hopes were entertained by our captain
that a few landward lads might nibble at the shilling.&nbsp; Over
one side of the square towered a tall whitewashed house of many
windows; and as I, with a uniform tunic that was the pride of the
<a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>regimental tailor, five feet eleven, twenty-one years
of age, and the vanity of a veteran, played my best to half a
dozen fifes, I noticed the lady at a window&mdash;the only window
in all that massive house-front to manifest any interest in our
presence or performance.&nbsp; I turned my silver drum a little
round upon my leg that it might reflect more dazzlingly the light
of the afternoon sun, and threw into my beats and rolls the most
graceful style that was at my command, all the while with an eye
on madam.&nbsp; It was my youthful conceit that I had caught her
fancy when, a little later&mdash;our sergeants busy among the
rustics&mdash;she came out from the house and over where I sat
apart beside my drum on the steps of the market cross.&nbsp; She
was younger than myself, a figure so airy and graceful, you would
swear that if she liked she could dance upon blue-bells without
bruising a petal; she had hair the colour of winter bracken in
sunshine, and the merriest smile.</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but I
<i>must</i> look at the darling drum&mdash;the sweet drum,&rsquo;
and caught the silken cords in her fingers, and ran a palm of the
daintiest hand I had ever seen over the shining barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she might, with more creditable human
sentiment, have had less interest in my drum and more in me, but
displayed my instrument with the best grace I could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know why I am so interested?&rsquo; she
asked in a little, looking at me out of deep brown eyes in which
I saw two little red-coated drummers, a thing which gave me back
my vanity and made me answer her only with a smile.&nbsp; Her
cheek for the first time reddened, and she hurried to
explain.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are Kildalton&rsquo;s drums.&nbsp; Mr
Fraser of Kildalton was my father, who is dead, and my mother is
dead too; and I pleated and tied these cords and tassels
first.&nbsp; How beautifully you keep them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Miss Fraser,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I
assure <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>you I could not keep them better if I tried; but, after
this, I shall have a better reason than ever for keeping them at
their best,&rsquo; a soldier&rsquo;s speech she smiled at as she
turned away.&nbsp; As she went into the tall white house again
she paused on the threshold and looked back for a moment at me,
smiling, and for the first time since I took the bounty I rued my
bargain, and thought I was meant for something more dignified
than drumming.&nbsp; From that hour I lived in the eyes of
Kildalton&rsquo;s daughter Margory.&nbsp; Once a week we went
fifing and drumming through the square.&nbsp; She was on these
occasions never absent from her window; there was never a smile
awanting for the smart young gentleman who beat the silver
drum.&nbsp; A second and a third time she came into the square to
speak to me.&nbsp; I made the most of my opportunities, and she
was speedily made to discover in the humble drummer a fellow of
race and education, a fellow with a touch of poetry, if you
please.&nbsp; She <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>was an orphan, as I have indicated&mdash;the ward of an
uncle, a general, at the time abroad.&nbsp; She lived on the
surviving fortune of Kildalton, in the tall white house, with an
elderly aunt and a servant.&nbsp; At our third interview&mdash;we
have a way of being urgent in the Army&mdash;she had trysted to
meet me that evening in the wood behind the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me do the girl justice, and say that the drum of
Kildalton brought her there, and not the drummer.&nbsp; At least,
she was at pains to tell me so, for I had mentioned to her, with
some of the gift of poetry I have mentioned, how infinitely
varied were the possibilities of an instrument she would never
have a proper chance to judge of in the routine of a
fife-and-drum parade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My billet was at the back of the town, on the verge of
a wood, with the window of my room opening on a sort of
hunting-path that went winding through the heart of <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>what I have
called a wood, but was in actual fact a forest of considerable
dimensions.&nbsp; I went out by the window that evening with my
drum, and walked, as had been arranged, about a mile among the
trees till I came to a narrow glen that cleft the hills, a burn
of shallow water from the peaty uplands bickering at the bottom
of it.&nbsp; A half moon swung like a halbert over the heights
that were edged by enormous fir-trees, and the wood was
melancholy with the continuous call of owls.&nbsp; They were soon
silenced, for I began to play the silver drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began with the reveille, though it was a properer
hour for the tattoo, playing it lightly, so that while it
silenced the hooting owls it did not affright the whole
forest.&nbsp; She came through the trees timidly, clothed, as I
remember, in a gown of green.&nbsp; She might have been the
spirit of the pine-plantings; she might have been a dryad charmed
from the swinging boughs.&nbsp; &lsquo;Margory! Margory!&rsquo; I
cried, my heart more <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>noisy than my drum had been, and
clasped her to my arms.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a poor drummer,
my dear,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and you a queen.&nbsp; If you do
not love me you were less cruel to take this dirk and stab me to
the heart than act the heartless coquette.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She faintly struggled.&nbsp; He hair fell loose in a
lock or two from under her hat, surged on her shoulder, and
billowed about my lips.&nbsp; Her cheek was warm; her eyes threw
back the challenge of the silver moon over the tops of pine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For a young gentleman from a kirk manse, Master
Drummer, you have considerable impertinence,&rsquo; said she,
panting in my arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My name, dear Margory, is George, as I have told
you,&rsquo; I whispered, and I kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;George, dear George,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;have done with folly!&nbsp; Let me hear the drumming and
go home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swung her father&rsquo;s drum again before <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>me and
gave, in cataracts of sound, or murmuring cascades, the
sentiments of my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wonderful!&nbsp; Oh, wonderful!&rsquo; she
cried, entranced; so I played on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon went into a cloud; the glade of a sudden
darkened; I ceased my playing, swung the drum again behind, and
turned for Margory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was gone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cried her name as I ran through the forest, but truly
she was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urquhart stopped his story and eagerly dashed some lines upon
the clay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
like that, for a moment.&nbsp; Ah! that is something like
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
followed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;indeed, I know&mdash;she loved me,
but&mdash;I went back to the war without a single word from her
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, to the deuce with your story!&rdquo; I cried at
that, impatient.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not bargain for a
tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>&ldquo;In truth it is something of a farce, as you
shall discover in a moment,&rdquo; said the sculptor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Next day the captain sent for me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know
General Fraser?&rsquo; said he, looking at a letter he held in
his hand.&nbsp; I told him I had not the honour.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it looks as if the family had
a curious penchant for the drum, to judge from the fact that his
brother gave yours to the regiment, and also&rsquo;&mdash;here he
smiled slyly&mdash;&rsquo;from the interest of his niece.&nbsp;
He is not an hour returned from Spain to his native town when he
asks me to send you with your drum to his house at
noon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very good, sir,&rsquo; I answered, with my heart
thundering, and went out of the room most hugely puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went at noon to the tall white house, and was shown
into a room where sat Margory, white to the lips, beside the
window, out of which she looked after a single hopeless glance at
me.&nbsp; A middle-aged gentleman in mufti, with an empty sleeve,
stood <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>beside her, and closely scrutinised myself and my
instrument as I entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the&mdash;the person you have referred
to?&rsquo; he asked her, and she answered with a sob and an
inclination of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have come&mdash;you are reputed to have come
of a respectable family,&rsquo; he said then, addressing me;
&lsquo;you have studied at Edinburgh; you have, I am told, some
pretensions to being something of a gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hope they are no pretensions, sir,&rsquo; I
answered warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;My people are as well known and as
reputable as any in Argyll, though I should be foolishly beating
a drum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said he, in no way losing his
composure.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can depend on getting the truth from
you, I suppose?&nbsp; You were with the 71st as drummer at Ciudad
Rodrigo?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was, sir,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Also
at Badajos, at Talavera, Busaco&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An excellent record!&rsquo; he
interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;I might have learned all about it later
had <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>not
my wound kept me two months in hospital after Ciudad.&nbsp; By
the way, you remember being sent as drummer with a picket of men
down a lane?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started, gave a careful look at him, and recognised
the General whose life I had doubtless saved from the pillaging
Portuguese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do, sir,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was you yourself who sent me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned with a little air of triumph to
Margory.&nbsp; &lsquo;I told you so, my dear,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I got but a distant glimpse of him this
forenoon, and thought I could not be mistaken.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
Margory sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My lad,&rsquo; he said, visibly restraining some
emotion, &lsquo;I could ask your drum-major to take the cords of
Kildalton my brother&rsquo;s drum and whip you out of a gallant
corps.&nbsp; I sent you with a picket&mdash;a brave lad, as I
thought any fellow should be who played Kildalton&rsquo;s drum,
and you came back a snivelling poltroon.&nbsp;
Nay&mdash;nay!&rsquo; he <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>cried, lifting up his hand and
checking my attempt at an explanation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You came out
of that infernal lane whimpering like a child, after basely
deserting your comrades of the picket, and made the mutilated
condition of your drum the excuse for refusing my order to go
back again, and I, like a fool, lost a limb in showing you how to
do your duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, General&mdash;&rsquo; I cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be off with you!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Another word, and I shall have you thrashed at the
triangle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fairly thrust me from the room, and the last I heard
was Margory&rsquo;s sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day I was packed off to the regimental depot, and
some weeks later played a common drum at Salamanca.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The sculptor rubbed the clay from his hands and took off his
overall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do to-day, I think,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am much better pleased than I was <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>yesterday,&rdquo; and he looked at his work with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the story, my dear Mr Urquhart.&nbsp; You
positively must give me its conclusion!&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the world should that not be its
conclusion?&rdquo; said he, drawing a wet sheet over the
bust.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you insist on the hackneyed happy
ending?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain you did not take your quittance from the
General in that way.&nbsp; You surely wrote to Margory or to him
with an explanation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sculptor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrote!&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think that
so obvious an idea would not occur to me?&nbsp; But reflect
again, I pray you, on the circumstances,&mdash;an obscure and
degraded drummer&mdash;the daughter of one of the oldest families
in the Highlands&mdash;the damning circumstantiality of her
uncle&rsquo;s evidence of my alleged poltroonery.&nbsp; My
explanation was too incredible for pen and paper; and <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>the
poltroon himself, the man who had brought the disgrace upon me,
was beyond my identification, even had I known where to look for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, Mr Urquhart,&rdquo; I insisted, all my
instincts as romancer assuring me of some other conclusion to a
tale that had opened on a note so cheerful, &ldquo;I feel sure it
was neither a tragedy nor a farce in the long-run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are right,&rdquo; he confessed,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was my drum that lost me the lady before
ever I met her, as it were, and it was but fair that my drum
should be the means of my recovering her ten years later.&nbsp; A
reshuffling of the cards of fortune in my family brought me into
a position where I was free to adopt the career of Art, and
by-and-by I had a studio of my own in Edinburgh.&nbsp; It was the
day of the portrait bust in marble.&nbsp; To have one&rsquo;s own
effigy in white, paid for by one&rsquo;s own self, in one&rsquo;s
own hall, was, in a way, the fad of <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>fashionable Edinburgh.&nbsp; It was
profitable for the artist, I admit,
but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it palled,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond belief!&nbsp; I grew to hate the appearance of
every fresh client, and it was then that I sought the solace of
this drum.&nbsp; When a sitter had gone for the day I drummed the
vexation out of me, feeling that without some such relief I could
never recover a respect for myself.&nbsp; And by-and-by I began
to discover in the instrument something more than a relief for my
feelings of revolt against the commercial demands on my
art.&nbsp; I found in it an inspiration to rare emotions: I found
in it memory.&nbsp; I found, in the reveilles and chamades that I
played in fields of war and in the forest to my Marjory, love
revived and mingled with a sweet regret, and from
these&mdash;memory, regret, and love&mdash;I fashioned what have
been my most successful sculptures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day a gentleman came with a commission for his own
portrait.&nbsp; It was General <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>Fraser!&nbsp; Of course, he did not
recognise me.&nbsp; Was it likely he should guess that the
popular sculptor and the lad he had sent in disgrace from the
tall white house in the distant Highland burgh town were
one?&nbsp; Nor did I at first reveal myself.&nbsp; Perhaps,
indeed, he would never have discovered my identity had not his
eyes fallen on my drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have had a military subject lately?&rsquo;
he said, indicating the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, General,&rsquo; I answered on an
impulse.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is a relic of some years of youthful
folly when I played Kildalton&rsquo;s silver drum, and it serves
to solace my bachelor solitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Heavens!&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;you, then, are
the drummer of Ciudad Rodrigo?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The same,&rsquo; I answered, not without a
bitterness.&nbsp; &lsquo;But a very different man from the one
you imagine.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then I told my story.&nbsp; He
listened in a curious mingling of apparent shame, regret, and
pleasure, and when I had ended was almost piteous in his <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>plea for
pardon.&nbsp; &lsquo;The cursed thing is,&rsquo; he said, that
Margory maintains your innocence till this very day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she should have that confidence in me,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;is something of a compensation for the past ten
years.&nbsp; I trust Miss Margory&mdash;I trust your niece is
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The General pondered for a moment, then made a
proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think, Mr Urquhart,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;that a half-winged old man is but a poor subject for any
sculptor&rsquo;s chisel, and, with your kind permission, I should
prefer to have a portrait of Miss Margory, whom I can swear you
will find quite worthy of your genius.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Urquhart in conclusion, &ldquo;and
so, indeed, she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but one <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>
possible,&rdquo; I said with profound conviction, and, as I said
it, a bar of song rose in the garden, serene and clear and
unexpected like the first morning carol of a bird in birchen
shaws.&nbsp; Then the door of the studio flung open, and the <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>singer
entered, with the melody checked on her lips whenever she saw the
unexpected stranger.&nbsp; She had hair the colour of winter
bracken in sunshine, and the merriest smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter Margory,&rdquo; said the sculptor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell your mother,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that I bring our
friend to luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>THE
SCOTTISH POMPADOUR.</h2>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span><span
class="smcap">Several</span> years ago there was no figure more
conspicuous on the boulevards of Paris at the fashionable hour
than that of the dandy called le Pompadour &eacute;cossais by the
journals.&nbsp; He had what will command attention anywhere, but
most of all in Paris&mdash;the mould of an Apollo, a tailor of
genius, the money of a Monte Cristo, and above all,
Mystery.&nbsp; In the speech of this tall, dark, and
sober-visaged exquisite there was no hint of a foreign
nationality.&nbsp; His French was perfect; his idioms were
correctly chosen; only his title, Lord Balgowie, and a foible for
the use of the checkered stuff his countrymen call tartan, in his
waistcoats, <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>proclaimed that he was a Scot.&nbsp; That he should
elect to spend his time in Paris seemed but natural to the
boulevardiers: it is the only place for young gentlemen of spirit
and the essential cash; but why should he feed himself like an
anchorite while he surfeited his friends? why, with such a gay
exterior, should be allied a mind so sober, private character so
blameless and austere?&nbsp; These problems exercised the
speculations of the caf&eacute; tables all the summer.</p>
<p>In the rue Adolphe Yvon, one of the most exclusive and
expensive streets in Paris, near enough to the Bois de Boulogne
to be convenient for morning exercise, but far enough removed to
be without the surge and roar of the tides of life that beat
there in the afternoons, the Pompadour &eacute;cossais had a
mansion like a palace, where he entertained the fashionable world
with the aid of a cook who seemed possessed of magic powers to
startle and delight, a wine-cellar <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>incredibly comprehensive, and a
retinue of servants such as the President of the Republic himself
could not command.&nbsp; If he dined at his house alone, he dined
with all the grandiose formality of Lucullus; if he patronised a
restaurant, he must have his private cabinet and a menu
unbelievingly extravagant.&nbsp; But strictly speaking, he never
dined alone, either in the rue Adolphe Yvon, Voisin&rsquo;s, or
Paillard&rsquo;s: he was invariably accompanied by a
fellow-countryman, who was his secretary or companion&mdash;a
fellow saturnine and cynical, who ate and drank voraciously,
while his master was content with the simplest viands and a glass
of water.</p>
<p>They had come in spring to the <i>Ville Lumi&egrave;re</i>,
and stepped, as it were, from the wagon-lit of the P.L.M. train
from the South into the very vortex of frivolity.&nbsp; You saw
the Pompadour &eacute;cossais in the morning riding in the Bois
on a snowy Irish hunter, wearing garments of a tone and cut that
<a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>promptly
set the fashion to the gommeaux, with a boutonni&egrave;re of
orchids; driving his coach through the avenues of Versailles in
the afternoon with a coat of gendarme blue with golden buttons;
at the clubs, the galleries, the opera, the caf&eacute;s, the
coulisses of the theatre&mdash;always the very latest cry in
fashion, ever splendid and inscrutable!&nbsp; Withal, he never
had so much as a sou in his pocket to buy a newspaper; his
secretary paid for all, and paid with nothing less than
gold.&nbsp; Balgowie, arbiter of elegance, envied by young men
for his style, was adored by the most fastidious and discerning
women for his sensibility, which was curiously out of keeping
with his life of waste.</p>
<p>Quite as deeply interested in the Pompadour as any of the
butterflies who fluttered round him in the rue Adolphe Yvon was a
poor old widow, wholly unknown, in Scotland, for every Saturday
she had a letter from her son, Balgowie&rsquo;s secretary.&nbsp;
She <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>read
of childish escapades, inordinate and unwholesome pleasures,
reckless prodigality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a miserable life!&rdquo; she would exclaim at the
news of some fresh imbecility, as it seemed to her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A hundred pounds for a breakfast!&nbsp; Five hundred
pounds for a picture to a lady!&nbsp; Oh, Jamie, Jamie, what a
master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grieved, indeed, exceedingly about the sinful course of
life in which her son was implicated, and more than once, for his
soul&rsquo;s sake, asked him to come back to Scotland, but always
he temporised.&nbsp; With Lord Balgowie he enjoyed a comfortable
salary; he had no profession at his hands, although he had had
the best of educations, thanks to his parents&rsquo; self-denial,
and he saw himself doomed for a term of years to follow the
progress of his rakish patron.</p>
<p>Her only comfort was in the shrewd and sober nature of his
comments on his master&rsquo;s follies.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
looked at his manner of life in all ways, mother,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;and <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>it seems to me deplorable.&nbsp; Once I had the notion
to be wealthy for the sake of the independence and the power for
good that money can command; now I can see it has a cankering
influence on the soul.&nbsp; I have gone with my lord to every
part of Europe, looking for content and&mdash;in his own
state&mdash;simple honesty, for friends to trust, and a
creditable occupation for the mind.&nbsp; Nothing in all the
capitals among the rich but idleness and riot and display,
cunning intrigue, self-seeking, and calculation.&nbsp; Thank God
that you&rsquo;re poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not so very poor, though, for he sent her thirty shillings
every week, a benefaction that enabled her to share among the
really poor who were her neighbours.&nbsp; For years that sum had
come to her with his letters every Saturday, often from towns
whose names in their foreign spelling were unknown to her; a
sense of opulence that caused her some uneasiness had more than
once compelled her to protest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>you deprive
yourself,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;and half that money would do
me finely.&nbsp; You should be saving, laddie; some day you will
want to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry,&rdquo; he wrote her back, incontinent; &ldquo;I
am here in a world of mannequins, and have yet to see the woman I
could be happy to sit with in auld age by a Scottish
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was not always to be of that mind.&nbsp; One day her
weekly letter held the fabulous sum of twenty pounds, and a hint
of his infatuation for a lady he had met in Paris.&nbsp; His
mother read his rhapsodies about the lass; they were, she
noticed, more about her wit and beauty than about her
heart.&nbsp; And in his letter was an unfamiliar undertone of
apprehension, secrecy, evasion, which her mother sense
discerned.</p>

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>The Pompadour &eacute;cossais rose one morning from his bed,
which once belonged to Louis Quatorze, in the rue Adolphe Yvon;
broke his fast on a bowl of coffee and a roll, and <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>having
dressed himself, as he always did, without a valet, with as much
fastidiousness as if he were the Duke de Morny, rode for an hour
in the wood, and later drove his English coach, with his English
horses, English grooms, and English post-horn, out to the garden
of St Germain.&nbsp; He was unusually resplendent, from his hat
of silk, broad-brimmed, widely banded with bombazine, to
high-heeled military shoes which seemed moulded to his feet, and
had never known an unguent, but were polished daily to a fine
dull lustre by the shin-bone of a deer.&nbsp; Upon his coat lapel
was a green carnation that had cost a louis; his secretary sat
behind him on the box, a man of undistinguished presence, wearing
a sardonic smile; on the seats behind him was a company of guests
for whom the lord had sieved the most exclusive salons of the
capital&mdash;Prevost and Chatran, Chelmonski the Napoleonic
painter, Paul Delourade the poet, <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>half a dozen women of the most
impeccable repute, and among them Mathilde de Langan with her
ponderous mother, who was overjoyed to think that, after years of
fruitless strategy, she was like to find an eminently eligible
son-in-law in Lord Balgowie.</p>
<p>The girl was altogether lovely, exquisitely moulded, in the
delicious gush of health and youthfulness, a miracle of grace
with an aspect that recalled the pictures of Italian Madonnas; a
brow benign and calm, a little tender mouth designed rather for
prayer than for kissing, eyes purple black, profound as wells and
prone to an alluring pensiveness.</p>
<p>They reached St Germain; stabled the horses, lunched upon the
terrace that looks widely over the plain of Paris; obsequious
silent servants hung about the tables; food and banter, wine and
laughter, fruit and flowers engaged the company as it sat between
the parterres, under awnings; and <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>apart a little, looking on with eyes
that gleamed at times with furtive and malicious entertainment,
sat the secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a singular man of yours, milord,&rdquo;
remarked Mathilde, who sat beside the Pompadour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have never seen him smile but in derision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a man with a peculiar sense of humour,&rdquo;
said the Pompadour, regarding her with gravely tender eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should not be surprised if the whole interior of that
apparently saturnine body is at this moment rumbling with
laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Vraiment</i>?&nbsp; What should he be laughing
at?&rdquo; asked the lady, whose judicious mother with discreet
consideration sought a wicker arm-chair, screened herself with a
quite unnecessary sunshade, and prepared to nap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what he must think the folly of&mdash;of my quest
for pleasure.&nbsp; He is, you know, my countryman, and the
happy-starred among us find content and joy in the very <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>cheapest,
simplest entertainment.&nbsp; The cost of&mdash;of those flowers
alone, perhaps he calculates at this moment, would suffice to
keep his mother a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! has he got a mother?&rdquo; said the
lady airily.&nbsp; &ldquo;To look at that rugged form and the
square hard countenance, I would have thought he had been chipped
from granite.&nbsp; But I hope the dear mother is not really
hungry.&nbsp; Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am privileged to read her letters once a week,&rdquo;
said the Pompadour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be most amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is at least instructive; she has her own ideas of
the life of fashion, and the character of le
Pompadour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she laugh, too, internally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy not,&rdquo; said the Pompadour reflectively;
&ldquo;I think it is more likely that she prays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How droll!&rdquo; said the saintly lips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I suppose it is the best that one can do <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>when one is
poor.&nbsp; If I were so rich as you, and derived so much
edification from her epistles, I should give her
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than she has from her son, who loves her, would
make her miserable.&nbsp; Sixty years of strict frugality spoil
the constitution for excess, and two guineas a week would make
her as uncomfortable as one of Joseph&rsquo;s dinners
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, at least, do not show appreciation of your
Joseph&rsquo;s dinners; you seem content with meagre soup and dry
biscuits; one might think you were a physician, and we the
subjects of experiment in indigestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame de Langan slept assuredly; the egrets on her hat bobbed
most grotesquely; now and then she gurgled.&nbsp; The company had
scattered, some to see the old home of the exiled James of
England, some to walk on the forest fringes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mathilde,&rdquo; said the Pompadour in a whisper,
taking her hand in his and bending towards her with a look of
burning <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>concentration.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I&mdash;if I were poor,
could you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started, bit her lip at a certain gaucherie in the
question, but did not withdraw her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I
cannot say,&rdquo; she stammered; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that a point
for the little mother?&rdquo; and she glanced at the sunshade
hiding the ponderous sleeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&nbsp; I know!&nbsp; I know!&rdquo; said the
Pompadour in a fury of impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this is our
Scottish fashion; first I must know from you, and then I shall
consult your mother.&nbsp; Meanwhile, do you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had no experience,&rdquo; said the lady, not
much embarrassed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have not told me yet if you
love me, which is, I understand, the customary ritual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!&rdquo; said he in an excess of
fervour, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a flame of passion and worship of
you,&rdquo; and he crushed unconsciously her fingers in his two
strong hands.</p>
<p>She winced.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Oh</i>, <i>ce n&rsquo;est pas
gentil</i>,&rdquo; she exclaimed, pulling away her hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>hurt me horribly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she smiled up in
his face, provocatively coquettish, whispering,
&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; for the other guests came trooping back
upon the terrace.</p>
<p>On the following evening, when the dark was falling upon
Paris, and the lamps began to bloom along the boulevards like
flowers of fire, a little woman, simple, elderly, and timid,
drove to the door of the mansion in the rue Adolph Yvon, and
asked to see his lordship&rsquo;s secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is from home, madam,&rdquo; said the English
servant, looking with curiosity at the homely figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From home!&rdquo; she exclaimed, beset with fears, and
realising now more poignantly than ever all the hazards of her
scheme.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must see him to-night; I am his
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is meantime with his lordship at the restaurant of
Voisin,&rdquo; said the domestic kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you
come in and wait for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you!&rdquo; she exclaimed;
&ldquo;but, if it were possible, I should like to see him
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put her in a cab, and gave the name of Voisin to the
driver.</p>
<p>Voisin&rsquo;s, in the rue Cambon, is a quiet and
unpretentious restaurant, dear to aristocratic Paris, since it
looks so cheap and really is expensive.&nbsp; So quiet, so
discreet, so restrained externally, men from the rural parts have
been known to go boldly in, misapprehending, and before they had
recovered from the blinding radiance of its tables, ask for a
brioche and a mug of beer.</p>
<p>To-night it had, more speciously than usual, the aspect of a
simple village inn: a hush prevailed; its waiters moved about on
list, and spoke in whispers; le Pompadour &eacute;cossais dined
<i>en prince</i> upstairs with a merry company, in a chamber upon
which the whole attention of the house was concentrated, from M.
le Gerant down to the <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>meanest kitchen scullion, for the
evening&rsquo;s entertainment was upon a scale of reckless
cost.&nbsp; Nothing would satisfy this wonderful man to-night but
curious foods far-borne from foreign lands, strange rare
beverages, golden vessels that had only once or twice been used
in the Tuileries in the last days of the Empire.&nbsp; If
diamonds could be crushed and turned by some miracle of alchemy
into a palatable bouillon, he, or properly his secretary, would
have cheerfully paid the cost.&nbsp; In an alcove screened by
palms a string quartette played the most sensuous music, so
exquisitely modulated that it seemed deliberately designed to
harmonise with rallies of wit and peals of laughter.</p>
<p>Mathilde, who sat to the right of the host, and by her saintly
aspect seemed at times incongruous with that company of
fashion&rsquo;s fools, was for once silent, thoughtful, and
demure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not told me yet if I may <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>hope,&rdquo; said the Pompadour to her in a tender
undertone, &ldquo;and we disperse in less than twenty
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she interrupted, with an impetuous
jewelled hand upon his knee; &ldquo;your friend has his eye on
us!&nbsp; That man makes me afraid&mdash;he looks so cold, so
supercilious!&nbsp; I hate to have a man regard me so who is
convulsed with inside laughter, as you say; he looks&mdash;more
like a conscience than a human secretary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Le Pompadour cast a glance across the room to the chair from
which his secretary was at the moment summoned by a whispered
message from the manager of the restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a student of life and men,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is his humour to put the follies of fashion underneath
the microscope of a mind as searchingly analytical as a
lens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad all Scots are not like that,&rdquo; said
the lady fervently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, you have the real French
temperament, and the <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>means to entertain it; your
secretary, were he as rich as you, I&rsquo;m sure would be a
skinflint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I can swear, you misjudge him,&rdquo; said the
Pompadour,&mdash;&ldquo;a man born unhappy, and spoiled for any
useful purpose, I am sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get rid of him&mdash;get rid of him!&rdquo; said the
lady, with a cleverly simulated shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the Pompadour, regarding her with
surprise, seeing for the first time cruelty in the mild Madonna
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon the secretary&rsquo;s stipend there
depend, you know, the comforts of a poor old Scottish
lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are so many openings for a perambulating
conscience!&nbsp; Those canaille!&nbsp; I am sure his frigid
countenance spoils your appetite; it would spoil mine&mdash;and
you eat like a Trappist monk.&nbsp; Is that Scots too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gluttony is the one aristocratic vice to <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>which I
could never become accustomed,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was&mdash;I was once, as many here to-night would think, quite
poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started slightly, looked incredulous.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
provoking it must have been!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he reflected soberly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Happiness&mdash;to speak platitude&mdash;has wonderfully
little to do with a bank account.&nbsp; You look so good and wise
I thought you had discovered that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered with deliberate acidity&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite disagree.&nbsp; I, at all events, could never
contemplate poverty with equanimity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not poverty,&rdquo; he protested
eagerly&mdash;&ldquo;not poverty!&nbsp; The young, the earnest,
and the hopeful know no poverty; they are not poor&mdash;where
there is love,&rdquo; and he searched her eyes as if his very
life depended on discovering there a sign of her agreement with
his sentiment.</p>
<p>She glanced about her at the indications <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>of the
speaker&rsquo;s wealth and prodigality, smiled cynically, tapped
him with her fan.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Farceur</i>!&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;now you are romantic, and to talk romance in seriousness
is ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden he saw her what she really was&mdash;vain, cruel,
calculating, parched in soul, despite her saintly face.&nbsp; He
stared at her, almost stunned by disillusion, seeing the
corruption of her nature rise like a scum upon the purple
eyes.</p>
<p>To the left of his chair the door of the reception salon
opened at the moment, and a voice beyond it plucked him from the
depths of his despondency.&nbsp; He rose, incredulous, and rushed
into the room, where a little old woman, simple and abashed at
her surroundings, stood beside the secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with his arms around her,
almost doubtful of her actual presence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought it
was your wraith.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>&ldquo;I fear I come at an awkward time,&rdquo; she
said pathetically; &ldquo;but all alone in this strange city,
what was I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come at the very time I want you,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had&mdash;I had forgotten things.&nbsp; I
have been play-acting, and the play is done!&nbsp; Was
this&rdquo;&mdash;and he turned to the
pseudo-secretary&mdash;&ldquo;was this a part of your
entertainment, Lord Balgowie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a most effective curtain,&rdquo; said the other,
smiling kindly on the little woman; &ldquo;but it was not,
strictly speaking, in the manuscript.&nbsp; I am glad the play,
as you say, is over; for I had begun to think you took the part,
in one respect, too seriously.&nbsp; I am honoured to meet you,
madam; you must be wearied after such a journey.&nbsp; Both of
you go at once to the rue Adolphe Yvon, and I shall make the
requisite apologies to the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw them to the street, and returned to join the
guests.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, with a
manner they had <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>never seen in him before, &ldquo;Le Pompadour has taken
his leave <i>&agrave; l&rsquo;anglais</i>, and my little joke has
terminated in the most dramatic fashion.&nbsp; I have long had a
desire to see, as a spectator, what for a dozen years I was under
the absurd impression was a life of pleasure; and, at the cost of
paying the bills myself and lending my worthy young compatriot my
name for a few months, I have had the most delicious and
instructive entertainment.&nbsp; In many respects he filled the
part of Lord Balgowie better than ever I could do; but two things
rather spoiled his admirable presentation&mdash;a homely taste in
viands, and his honest heart!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>THE
TALE OF THE BOON COMPANION.</h2>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Every</span> man his boon
companion, every man his maid,&rdquo; they say in Argyll.&nbsp;
Somewhere in the wide world are both the man and the maid, but
not always do they come to your door.&nbsp; You may pass the maid
at the market, never thinking she was meant to mother your
bairns, and her lot thereafter may be over many hills, baking
bannocks of oaten meal on another man&rsquo;s
hearth&mdash;that&rsquo;s your ill-fortune; the boon companion
may wander by the change-house where you sit drinking
late&mdash;drinking late and waiting to learn the very songs he
knows, and he <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>may never come that road again; but whether that is
good for you or ill is the most cunning of God&rsquo;s
secrets.&nbsp; I could tell nine hundred tales and nine of boon
companions who met the friend they were meant for, but I have
still to learn the art of seeing the end from the beginning of
any comradeship.</p>
<p>This particular and ancient history that I am telling is a
story that is to be heard on winter nights in the fir-wood
bothies of Upper Loch Finne.&nbsp; It is the story of an affair
that happened in the wild year before the beginning of the little
wars of Lorn.</p>
<p>Colkitto Macdonald and his Irishry and the Athol clans came,
as the world knows, to Argyll, and carried the flambeau and the
sword through every glen in the country-side.&nbsp; Into our
peaceable neighbourhood, so harmless, so thriving and content,
they marched on a winter&rsquo;s end&mdash;wild bearded fellows,
ravenous at the <a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>eyes, lean as starved roebucks, cruel as the Badenoch
wolves.&nbsp; They put mother and child to the pike; the best men
of all our Gaelic people found the hero&rsquo;s death when
standing up against these caterans, but uselessly.&nbsp; Carnus,
Cladich, and Knapdale are thick with green spots where Clan
Diarmaid&rsquo;s massacred people fell in the troubles.</p>
<p>To that rich and beautiful country the spring of the year
comes always with vigour for the young heart.&nbsp; One feels the
fumes of myrtle and fir in the head like a strong wine.&nbsp; It
is the season of longing and exploits, and, if adventure is not
in the way, the healthy young blood will be stirred to love or
manly comradeship.&nbsp; Then the eye is keenest for the right
girl, or (it may happen) the boon companion comes by the right
chance, and leads the one waiting for him into the highroads
where magic is at every corner, and old care is a carle to snap a
finger at.&nbsp; There are no meats so <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>sappy, no
drink so generous and hearty, no sleep so sound as in that age
and time.</p>
<p>It was in that season that the two men of my story met at a
<i>ceilidh</i>, as we call a night gossiping, in a
tacksman&rsquo;s house in Maam.</p>
<p>There had been singing of the true Gaelic songs and telling of
Gaelic stories.&nbsp; A fellow, Alan, sat in a dusky corner of
the room with a girl, Ealasaid, and they had little heed of song
or story, but whispered the sweet foolishnesses of their kind in
a world of their own, till a man new over from Cowal&mdash;Red
John, by the byname&mdash;stood to his feet and sang a Carrick
ditty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard better,&rdquo; said Alan in the
girl&rsquo;s ear, for the new man and his new song had cried them
back to the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough, I&rsquo;m not denying,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;but he looks slack; you never saw a man with a low lip so
full and a laugh so round and ready who was not given to
wandering.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo; asked young Alan, his eyes
roving between the girl and the man singing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From&mdash;oh! from good guidance,&rdquo; said she,
flushing; &ldquo;from the plain ways of his more common and
orderly neighbours&mdash;from the day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; said Alan, &ldquo;had no
great hold on my fancy, and still and on I&rsquo;m not what one
would call lazy.&nbsp; I wish, do you know, I could sing yon
jovial gentleman&rsquo;s songs, and think life so humoursome as
I&rsquo;ll warrant a man with that laugh finds it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He learned Red John&rsquo;s best songs before summer-time, for
Red John was his boon companion.</p>
<p>They wandered, the pair of them, day after day and dusk after
dusk, in the way of good-fellowship, coming on many jovial
adventures, gathering curious songs, meeting free-handed folk and
bits of good fortune.&nbsp; They went many a time on the <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>carouse of
true comradery, and Alan, who should be loving a girl, sat with
this merry Cowal man in wayside ale-houses, drinking starlight
and the drug of the easy heart from earthen jars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you come to meet me to-morrow?&rdquo; once asked
Ealasaid, finding her lover alone on his way to a new
folly.&nbsp; She put a hand on his arm and leaned up against his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where would we go?&rdquo; he asked, tucking a loose
lock of her hair behind her ear, less for his love of trimness
than to get some occupation for his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It used to be enough that it was with me when I asked
before,&rdquo; said Ealasaid, staying his fingers; &ldquo;but my
cousin-german in Coillebhraid asks us up to curds and
cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John and I are promised at a wrestling in the
town,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;would the next day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drew her screen about her like one smitten by a cold
wind.</p>
<p><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>&ldquo;Alan, Alan! your worst friend!&rdquo; said
she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decentest lad in the world; he quarrels with
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For cowardice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He understands me in every key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the readier can he make you the
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has taught me the finest songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sing in the ale-house&mdash;a poor schooling, my
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never before saw the jollity of living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no flattery to one Ealasaid; has he said
aught of the seriousness of death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alan hummed the end of a verse and then laughed slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lass,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;does it make much differ
that he thinks you the handsomest girl in the parish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would sooner you yourself thought me the plainest,
and yet had some pleasure in my company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday (on a glass), he said your <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>eyes were
the fullest, your hair the yellowest, your step the lightest,
your face the sweetest in all real Argyll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s the man who should be doing your
courting,&rdquo; said the girl, with a bitterness; and she went
home sore-hearted.</p>
<p>The days passed on birds&rsquo; feathers; the brackens
coarsened in the gloomy places of the forest; the young of bird
and beast lost themselves in the tangled richness of the field
and wood.&nbsp; No rains came for many days, and the sun, a
gallant horseman, rode from hill to hill, feasting his eye on the
glens he saw too seldom.</p>
<p>In those hours the winds dozed upon the slimmest stem of
heather; the burns, that for ordinary tear down our braes,
bragging loud to the lip, hung back in friendly hollows under
saugh-branch, rowan, and darach leaf; &ldquo;but a little
sleep,&rdquo; said they&mdash;&ldquo;a little sleep, that we may
finish a dream we woke in the middle of,&rdquo; and the
grasshopper&rsquo;s chirrup drowned their prayer.</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>In
their old fashion the glensfolk shifted for the time their homes
to the shielings high up on the hills, in the breasts of the
corries where are sappy levels that the heifers come to from the
cropped glens like misers to a gentleman&rsquo;s table.&nbsp;
While their cattle on the long day ends tugged the crisp grasses,
the people would come out of their bothies and huts and sit in a
company, above them the openings between the hills, the silver
dusk that never grew dark, and the prickle of stars.&nbsp; Then
Red John carried himself among the company like a chief, full of
<i>bardachd</i>, <a name="citation295"></a><a href="#footnote295"
class="citation">[295]</a> of wit, of the most fairy music, so
that even the girl whose lover he borrowed gave him credit for a
warlock&rsquo;s charm.</p>
<p>It was not the genius of him, but the affable conduct and his
gentleman&rsquo;s parts.&nbsp; A scamp, with duty near tugging at
the cuff of his doublet, he went dancing through life, regardless
as a bird.&nbsp; Had you a grievance <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>against him?&mdash;he forgave you
with a laugh, and took you by the elbow, telling some gaiety in
your ear.&nbsp; Your most sober mood fell before his rallying
like mist from the hillside in sun and breeze.&nbsp; Honest, true
to his word as to his friend, fond of a glass, fond of a lass:
they called him the boon friend of the shielings.</p>
<p>And wherever he went, this light-head, in humour and
carelessness, Alan walked faithful at his heels, nearer his heart
than any foster-brother, more and more learning his ways of
idleness and diversion.</p>
<p>Ealasaid at last went to this Cowal fellow once complaining,
with some shame, for a Highland girl has small heed to speak of
the heart&rsquo;s business to any man but one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my dear, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he
said, with no pretence in the vexation of his brow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I tempt no one to folly, and surely I&rsquo;m not to blame
for friendship to a lad so fine a woman can have the heart to
think the best of.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>&ldquo;You are his blackest foe,&rdquo; she said
stormily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m foe to none, woman,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;except perhaps to a man they call Red John, and the worst
enemy ever I had was welcome to share the last penny in my
sporran.&nbsp; I have my weakness, I&rsquo;ll allow, but my worst
is that my promise is better than my performance, and my most
ill-judged acts are well intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blame yourself,&rdquo; said Ealasaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I blame nobody,&rdquo; said he, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If other folk get such contentment out of their good deeds
as I get out of my good intentions, it&rsquo;s no bad world to
spend a while in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like the weak man in the <i>ceilidh</i>
story,&rdquo; pressed the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; quo&rsquo; he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you botch life,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let a girl tell it you.&nbsp; And the pity of it is
you&rsquo;ll do it to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the worst of Ealasaid&rsquo;s heart-break and the folly of
Alan and his boon <a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>companion, the men of Antrim and Athol came scouring
over from Lorn into the glens of MacCailein Mor.&nbsp; They found
a country far from ready to meet them, the leader himself from
home, the sentinels sleeping, the forts without tenants.&nbsp; It
was a bitter winter, and those gentlemen of Antrim and Athol kept
their hides warm by chasing new-made orphans on to the frozen
rivers.&nbsp; When the bairns ran on the ice crying, and went
through it to a cold death, the good gentry laughed at the
merriment of the spectacle.&nbsp; Down Aora glen went the bulk of
them, and round the Gearran road to Shira glen, behind them
smoking thatch and plundered folds.</p>
<p>Death struck with an iron hand at the doors of Maam, Elrigmore
and Elrigbeg, Kilblane and Stuckgoy, and at Stuckgoy lived the
girl of my story.&nbsp; She would have been butchered like her
two brothers, by the fringe of Athol&rsquo;s army, but for her
lover and his friend, who came when the need was <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>the sorest
for them, and led her out behind the spoiled township in the
smoke of the burning byres.</p>
<p>There had been a break in the frost.&nbsp; It was a day of
rain and mist, so the men who chased them lost them early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can reach the head of the glen first,&rdquo; said
Alan, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s safety in the Ben Bhuidhe
cave.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the cave they ran for.</p>
<p>The cave is more on Ben Shean than Ben Bhuidhe, for all its
name; a cunning hiding-place on the face of Sgornoch-mor rock,
hanging over the deer wallows where the waters of Shira and
Stacan sunder, seeking Lochow and Loch Finne.&nbsp; It was the
home of the reiver when reiving was in vogue, a hold snug and
easy for sleep, and deep enough for plunder.&nbsp; Fires might
flash at night far ben in the heart of it, or songs might shake
its roof, but never the wiser was the world outbye.</p>
<p>The way to the cave was off Shira side at the head of the
glen, among whin bush <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>and hazel, bending to the left over
the elbow of Tomgorm, and a haw-tree hung above the face of
Sgornoch-mor.&nbsp; The cave itself lay half-way down the rock,
among a cluster of wild berry bushes that clung finger and claw
to a ledge so narrow that a man with a dirk could keep it against
a score of clans.&nbsp; To reach it there was but one way all
Glenshira folk knew, and none beside them&mdash;by a knotted rope
that always lay at the root of the haw-tree for that
purpose.&nbsp; Once in, and the rope with you, and your way to
the foot of the rock was easy; but once in, and the rope
awanting, and the place was your grave, for you might starve in
the face of the birds that flapped on black feathers to their
nests that were lower still on the rock.</p>
<p>The girl and her friends reached the head of the glen well
before the band that followed them on the beaten road.&nbsp;
There the mist fell off, and the bare hills closed in on a gullet
the wind belched through.&nbsp; <a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>Before them was Tomgorm, and they
took to the left and the climbing, Ealasaid and Alan in front and
Red John behind them, checking the whistling of pibrochs at his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl, poor girl!&rdquo; said he to himself,
&ldquo;I was wrong to have come between you in the long summer
day, for here&rsquo;s in truth the black winter and the short
day, homelessness and hunger, and the foe on our
heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got on the front of Sgornoch-mor, and all the north
Highlands free of mist were in broken peaks before them, cut with
glens, full of roads to liberty and safety, but too far off for a
quarry before the hounds.</p>
<p>At the foot of the haw-tree was the rope in coils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little time to waste,&rdquo; said Red
John, &ldquo;for though I said nothing of it at the braefoot, I
heard a corps of our followers too close on our heels for
comfort.&nbsp; It would <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>be leading them to our den below,
and us to some trouble, if they saw the way we went.&nbsp; Will
you go first, mistress, and Alan and I will follow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could die sweetly where I stand,&rdquo; said
Ealasaid, shrunk in weariness and grieving, &ldquo;but for Alan
here,&rdquo; she added, looking at the lad beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying here, dying there,&rdquo; said Red John,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dance a reel at your wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was fastening the rope round Ealasaid&rsquo;s waist as he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing in my mind,&rdquo; he said, in
some confusion of voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; she asked, with small interest
written in her swimming eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Alan,&rdquo; said he (and busy about
the rope): &ldquo;I am your debtor for many hours I robbed you
of, unthinking&mdash;my old weakness, as I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all bye,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all bye and done with.&nbsp; Do you fancy
I&rsquo;m thinking now of such small sorrows?&nbsp; If <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>you
borrowed my lover, you pay for the loan with my life saved; I owe
you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all the better pleased to hear you say
it,&rdquo; said Red John, &ldquo;because your taunt about my
botched life rankled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did you less than justice; one should never judge a
life till the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the rock face the two men lowered her to the cave, where
she let herself free of the rope, with a shake of it for her
signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, lad,&rdquo; said Red John, looking into the
glen; and Alan went over the edge, and down, foot and hand, eager
enough to join Ealasaid.</p>
<p>The torn mists blew farther down the glen, the wind took a
curve round Sgornoch-mor, and eye and ear told Red John that a
band of the Athol men were close on him.&nbsp; He saw their
bonnets on the slope, and heard them roar when they saw him
beside the haw-tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sorrow!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Red John
<a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>at the
end of his tether!&nbsp; The pair below need be none the worse
nor the wiser, for who&rsquo;s to get at them with the rope
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted the rope a little to make sure that Alan was off it,
then slashed at it with his dirk till he cut it from the
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a cunning and notable end to the botched
life,&rdquo; said the boon companion to himself, turning, with
the dagger still in his hand, to face the Athol men.</p>
<p>And the rope in heavy coils fell past the cave mouth to the
deep below.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
